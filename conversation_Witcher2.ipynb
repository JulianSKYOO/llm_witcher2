Yet another boggy shithole.[Geralt examines the nearby corpse on the shore.]GERALT: Attacked by necrophages. Not much left for me here... Let's just see who he was.GERALT: Necrophages'll likely come for the corpse. I should get to the village before sundown.[Geralt loots the corpse, discovering the person was invited to a tournament, and moves on up the path. In front of a hut he comes to an injured man.]KNIGHT: *Akough hack hrrr... Ahouck he hah*KNIGHT: Who are you?GERALT: I'm not gonna hurt you. Will you let me look at your wounds?KNIGHT: Odd, you don't resemble a traveling preacher...KNIGHT: Damn the dogs, it hurts to talk... I wager my armor's the only thing keeping me in one piece...GERALT: I'll find some help.KNIGHT: Futile, I'm afraid. Around here, folk don't open their doors to strangers. You would do well to find my squire. I'd like to thrash his hide for fleeing from those corpse-eaters - consider it my final wish.GERALT: I found his body by the river.GERALT: Listen, let me brew you a health potion. You're no witcher, so it could kill you, but if I'm not mistaken, you already think you're dead. There's a slim chance that your body will quell the toxins and regenerate.KNIGHT: I'll expire in this hole before I let someone turn me into a mutant.GERALT: That's not how it works. Stay calm and lie still. I need to find some herbs.[Geralt collects the necessary herbs and brews a Healing Brew.]GERALT: Knock back this potion. Try not to vomit.GERALT: Drink it.KNIGHT: Ugh!GERALT: You're still alive, so that bodes well. But you've got a ways to go before you're at full health. Now, you have to sit and wait. You're no mutant, so it'll be a couple of days before you recover and we can get you out of here.KNIGHT: Thank you, witcher. Ugh, Hallowed Kreve...GERALT: Didn't have the chance earlier... I'm Geralt of Rivia.KNIGHT: Bolton of Ironford.What happened here?BOLTON: I wanted to try my luck in the arena, but some corpse-eaters surprised me. My horse reared, and I came crashing down in full armor. They pounced upon me with their claws. Though broken, I managed to drive them off and crawl here... Pitiful story, but there it is.GERALT: Hm, that could mean some paid work for me.BOLTON: Doubtful. If the corpses weren't eaten, they would rot, emit a stench and breed pestilence... Ugh, damn the dogs...BOLTON: Those who fall in the arena - their bodies are cast into the ravine. The dead offer little in terms of diversion, I'm afraid, except perhaps to monsters.Get well. I've gotta go. [EXIT]GERALT: Get well, Bolton of Ironford. And farewell.BOLTON: You must take my invitation. If but half of what I've heard about witchers is true, you ought to manage well in the arena.GERALT: Thanks, Bolton.BOLTON: I thank you. And now, Geralt of Rivia, if you've no objection, I would finally like to get some sleep.[Geralt continues down the path to the gate of a town.]GATEKEEPER: Who stalks the night? Begone, cursed soul, or I'll stick the hounds on you!GERALT: Got corpse-eaters on this side, so I'll take your hounds any day.GATEKEEPER: A jester, eh? You're all jesters, you all think you're droll, till you enter the arena. No room for jokin' around in there.GERALT: I'm not trying to be funny. I'm soaked and I'm freezing. Let me in.GATEKEEPER: Ah-hah! A vampyre. I'll not let a bloodsucker in, oh no! I've got eels in garlic here. What do you say to that?GERALT: I'll gladly submit to the eels in garlic trial. And the running water trial. And the beer trial...GATEKEEPER: Who knows what you are. Evil crawls the night, corrupting the righteous. I'll wait for morn, for the cock to crow. If the rising sun don't scare you off, I'll let you in.GERALT: You want me to wait here?GERALT: You there!GERALT: All right. Let's find a place to rest.[Attempting to talk to the Gatekeeper again before dawn yields one of the following lines.]GATEKEEPER: Begone, 'fore I drive a stake through you!GATEKEEPER: Wait for the cock to crow, I said.GATEKEEPER: A restless soul you are. Go to sleep... damned fool.GATEKEEPER: The sun has yet to rise.GATEKEEPER: Back to bed. Or your coffin...[Geralt meditates until dawn.]GATEKEEPER: Still there, foul soul?GERALT: Yeah, I'm still here - and the cock has crowed. As far as being foul, well, I may smell a bit...GATEKEEPER: Has it got an invitation?GERALT: It has.GATEKEEPER: Then it may enter. Good luck to it in the arena.[Geralt enters the arena and fights a variety of foes. After he exits the arena, the difficulty of the game is determined and the game starts.]\"),\n",

Unscrupulous scoundrels without conscience and virtue, they are veritable creatures from hell, capable only of taking lives...MONSTRUM - A PORTRAYAL OF WITCHERS, ANONYMOUS\\xa0Six years have passed since that memorable day when the Northern Kingdoms, their forces united, defeated the hosts of Nilfgaard in open battle at Brenna.\\xa0Famine and disease reign in all the North. Elves and dwarves inhabit ghettos. In ever increasing numbers, they flee to the forests to join Scoia\\'tael units.\\xa0In Temeria, an unidentified assassin attempts to murder King Foltest. The killer dies at the hands of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer.\\xa0A month passes. On the banks of the Pontar River, Foltest\\'s army is victorious once more, ending civil strife in the country. Yet the price of this triumph proves immense.][Geralt runs through a forest in the dark and the rain, while voices call out his name. He finally collapses into unconsciousness. We see Lambert and Berengar running towards his fallen body, while someone laughs in the distance.][Geralt comes back to consciousness hanging inside a dungeon cell while two Temerian guards play dice on the table outside.]GUARD 1: Come on, sixes. Daddy needs you.GUARD 1: Aw, shit!GUARD 2: Hah! Twenty orens to granddad.GUARD 1: Lookie there - he\\'s awake.GUARD 2: You daft? Don\\'t go in there!GUARD 1: Shut it. He\\'s in chains, can\\'t do a thing.GUARD 1: Am I right, master Geralt?[Guard 1 punches Geralt, knocking him unconscious again.]GUARD 1: Roll again!GUARD 2: Why?GUARD 1: The dice didn\\'t roll.GUARD 2: Calling me a cheat? Take it back!GUARD 1: Look... He\\'s awake again.[They enter the cell and begin tormenting Geralt.]GUARD 2: Monster slayer, my arse. A regular whoreson.GUARD 1: I heard witchers all start out as roadside orphans taken in by mages. Mages who experiment on \\'em.GUARD 2: Folk say they plough witches come the equinox.GUARD 1: That\\'s how they get those spooky eyes.[Vernon Roche appears.]ROCHE: Enough. Take him down and put him in the interrogation room.GERALT: I thought you\\'d died.ROCHE: I\\'m not so easy to kill.[The guards take Geralt down. He is next seen sitting at a table with hands chained behind his back. Roche enters the room.]ROCHE: I don\\'t believe we\\'ve been introduced... Vernon Roche.I\\'d shake your hand if I could...GERALT: Walk around behind me if you want to shake.ROCHE: How foolish of me. Ves! Unshackle him.[Ves comes in and does so.]GERALT: Geralt... of Rivia. Care to introduce us?VES: No thanks.ROCHE: Bring something to drink. We can\\'t sit here cotton-mouthed.Very funny.GERALT: Fuck you.ROCHE: Nasty... And after we\\'ve been through so much...GERALT: Same side of the barricade then, opposite sides of the table now.ROCHE: You can change that.GERALT: You want me to sit on your lap?ROCHE: Ves! Unshackle him.ROCHE: You will tell me everything you remember, the entire assault... and all that happened in the solar.GERALT: And if I refuse?ROCHE: I shall have to beat you. I\\'ve commanded the special forces for a while. Got good at beating others. You\\'re a witcher. You\\'d endure much.GERALT: You better believe it.ROCHE: Worst case scenario - you\\'ll suffer through it, go back to your cell, and tomorrow...ROCHE: They\\'ll publicly gut you, skin you and hang you.GERALT: Just like that? For nothing?ROCHE: No. For Temeria.GERALT: Downright praiseworthy. Where should I start?ROCHE: It was a long day. I wish to hear the important bits.That morning, the King summoned me.GERALT: Just so we\\'re clear on this, I was not eager to go into battle.GERALT: But Foltest is not someone you refuse.  2.2 - BY THE KING\\'S WILL < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt wakes and sits up on a bed inside a tent. Triss is lying beside him, naked and still sleeping. He runs his hand up her body and she wakes up. They embrace, but are interrupted by a soldier opening the tent flap.]TRISS: Witcher, are you up?!GERALT: Pfff...TRISS: His Majesty, King of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam and Sodden, Senior Protector of Brugge... summons Master Geralt to appear before him.GERALT: Tell him I\\'ll be there shortly.TRISS: Sorry to intrude like this, m\\'Lady, but the King...GERALT: We heard you.TRISS: A pleasant day to you, m\\'Lady, witcher.[Soldier leaves.]GERALT: Stupid war... It could\\'ve been such a beautiful morning...TRISS: A war can never be stupid when waged by your king.There are no wise wars.GERALT: A wise war is a contradiction, Triss.TRISS: Then maybe you know just how I should advise our lustful monarch?GERALT: Stop falling in love, sire no further bastards, and don\\'t wage stupid wars.TRISS: Genius. You know these bastards could vie for the throne in the future? Then we\\'d have an even more senseless conflict.GERALT: Which doesn\\'t change the fact that...People are dying because of a lovers\\' spat...GERALT: They\\'ve cleared the forests, they\\'re pillaging nearby villages, and they\\'ll soon be murdering each other en masse. Why? Because Foltest\\'s having a spat with the mother of his bastard twins...GERALT: This is a really stupid war, Triss.TRISS: Bastards or not, the children are still royal blood. The La Valettes are an old Temerian dynasty and the mix is sufficient basis to vie for the crown... History has known stranger contenders.GERALT: Which doesn\\'t change the fact that...TRISS: I know, Foltest and the other northern monarchs are neither the smartest nor the most refined. But they\\'re kings, one of whom we serve.GERALT: And I\\'ll see Foltest as summoned - protect him if need be - but once the castle falls, we leave.[Geralt puts on his armor, not looking at Triss.]TRISS: Did you dream of the Wild Hunt again?GERALT: Mhm...A scout reported seeing a dragon.GERALT: One of the scouts swears he saw a dragon down by the river... Claims he ran into a Scoia\\'tael unit. That would\\'ve been it if the dragon hadn\\'t swooped down. The elves apparently bowed in prayer and he escaped.TRISS: A dragon? In the midst of civilization? Please... Besides, does it matter? Witchers don\\'t hunt dragons. Or has something changed?GERALT: Nothing\\'s changed. And you\\'re right, it\\'s probably not a dragon. Although it could be a forktail or a slyzard, maybe even an overgrown wyvern...TRISS: The scout ran into some elves and scurried away - that\\'s how that story begins and ends.Learn anything about the assassin?GERALT: The unlucky assassin - how did the autopsy go?TRISS: It was a nightmare. In the month since you killed him, the King\\'s medics poked around in his corpse like a bunch of amateurs. What arrived in that cart... well, I wouldn\\'t even call it a corpse...GERALT: Foltest has some trust issues. Did you learn anything?TRISS: His pupils suggested he could probably see in the dark as well as you. I couldn\\'t put an age on him.GERALT: The killer snuck past all the guards and nearly killed Foltest and me a month ago. And now you tell me he was a witcher?TRISS: Possibly. I\\'m just saying what the autopsy showed. I haven\\'t told anyone, nor do I plan to. I know what it could do to you if it got out.TRISS: You might be a savior, a king\\'s witcher now, but masters can be as fickle as the colts they ride...That dream...GERALT: I get the feeling that dream\\'s important. Running franticly through the forest, the Wild Hunt – they\\'re the last things I remember.GERALT: I wake up and try to relive the dream and the memory, hoping I\\'ll find some guidance. Some clue to grab onto, something that\\'ll help me recover my memory...TRISS: Dreams can be very powerful. Some people claim they can even shape reality.GERALT: People claim a lot of things. The problem is - it\\'s often nonsense.TRISS: We\\'ll know in time, I\\'m sure of it.Time to go.GERALT: All right. Time to look to the lustful king and his stupid war.TRISS: I\\'ll join you later.  2.3 - Newboy\\'s Amulet (Melitele\\'s Heart) < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[On his way to see Foltest, Geralt comes across a circle of men talking to each other.]DESBRUT: Word is, way up north there\\'s a tribe of wild men who go into battle stark naked.KENNET: Whereas you\\'ll have your trousers protectin\\' your jewels, and that magic amulet! Hah! I wager you\\'ll send the La Valettes running...NEWBOY: I just know I\\'m gonna die... Shite, I don\\'t wanna die on a bet.KENNET: It\\'s the Crinfrid Reavers\\' honor that\\'s at stake here. This is no time to whimper.DESBRUT: You one of us or not?KENNET: Ooh! Lookie there, Newboy, it\\'s that witcher... Geralt of Rivia ought to know about amulets.NEWBOY: Witcher, sir! I\\'ve a question for you...GERALT: We know each other?KENNET: Don\\'t recognize your old mates? We\\'re the Crinfrid Reavers.GERALT: I lost my memory.DESBRUT: As did Boholt! After the hunt for the golden dragon, he took a spill and hit his head on a rock. He can still be a beast in battle, but \\'sides that, he don\\'t do much save eat and shit. Rarely even lusts after women...GERALT: I doubt that\\'s amnesia...KENNET: I\\'m Kennet, and this one here they call Desbrut, and this is Newboy - he\\'s, uh, apprenticing with us, like. Haven\\'t had much luck with monsters of late, so we enlisted. Now Newboy\\'s gotten hisself into this wager situation...Would you help us for old time\\'s sake?KENNET: I mean, we all got a little riled, but those are bygones, as I see it...DESBRUT: We\\'d have set you free, the sorceress, too. Boholt was just foolin\\' about the rapin\\' and all.Rape?GERALT: What rape?KENNET: Shut your trap, Desbrut. The witcher don\\'t remember - waste of words to remind him. We\\'re old mates, that\\'s that.GERALT: So you\\'d have raped this old mate?KENNET: Just the sorceress. You were there to kill the dragon, the sorceress, too, the peasants wanted at it, everyone did... But, there was only one prize. And we argued, there was some commotion, a regular rumble, in fact.KENNET: We tied you up like hogs, meanin\\' you and the sorceress, and went after the beast. But that dragon thrashed us so hard we spent the next half year lickin\\' our wounds. And you done freed yourselves of your bonds...GERALT: Who was the sorceress?KENNET: Raven-haired she was... Hm, remember her name Desbrut?DESBRUT: Err, Connifer or some such... So, willin\\' to help some old friends, witcher?I don\\'t have time for this.GERALT: Sorry, I\\'m fresh out of time. The King\\'s summoned me.DESBRUT: Aww, piss off, witcher. You haven\\'t changed a bit. Just ploughin\\' a different witch!GERALT: What was that?KENNET: Newboy, grab your sword. You only live once. Let the knighthood see that we Crinfrid Reavers...GERALT: Wait, this sorceress...KENNET: No time to help your mates, but you\\'re glad to stop and talk about some bird, eh?DESBRUT: Maybe we ought to try this talisman on the witcher...KENNET: We\\'d hang. He\\'s the King\\'s favorite now. They\\'re sounding the assembly. That\\'s us.NEWBOY: I\\'ll feel like a git going out in knickers alone...You sure it\\'ll work?KENNET: Let\\'s go!GERALT: There\\'s clearly magic in the trinket, but I doubt it\\'ll deflect swords or arrows...NEWBOY: Shit, I knew it. I told you so, you idiot...DESBRUT: Screw honor. Don your metal, Newboy, you\\'ll go into battle confessional and all.KENNET: So be it, though I\\'d like to have fleeced the noble. Damn shame...What\\'s the problem?[Same as \"What\\'s the story with the wager?\"]What\\'s the story with the wager?KENNET: It\\'s a matter of life, death and quite a bit of coin, in point of fact... Newboy bet a knight that he\\'ll survive the assault in his shirt and knickers alone. We\\'d drunk a bit by then, I admit, but a wager\\'s a wager - our honor\\'s at stake.GERALT: A soldier\\'s honor versus a knight\\'s? I think I get it.KENNET: The very core of the matter, witcher. We\\'re slated to go in the first wave, so the going\\'s liable to be hard. Newboy\\'s brave, but he can\\'t survive by courage alone... In any case, we\\'ve come into this bauble that\\'s supposed to protect him, magically like.KENNET: You mind casting an expert\\'s glance at it, seeing as sorcery and such is not strange to you...?GERALT: Lemme see this bauble.NEWBOY: Your wolf medallion! I saw it shake!GERALT: It reacts to magic...DESBRUT: So it\\'s true, what the priest said? Hear that, Newboy? You\\'ll be safe. We\\'ll fleece that knight, we will!The amulet could help.GERALT: Who knows. The amulet just might help.KENNET: All right, that settles it. The witcher says the amulet\\'ll help.NEWBOY: Farkin\\' hell. I\\'ll not go into battle in me knickers alone!KENNET: Nuggin, we win that wager, we\\'ll be rich men, remember that. Besides, what\\'s the joy in taking a castle in full plate? They\\'ll sing ballads about you, I tell you.KENNET: They\\'re sounding the assembly... That\\'s us. Thanks, witcher. We\\'ll be sure to get you a share of those winnings.DESBRUT: And who knows, we might get another shot at that golden dragon some day...I doubt it.GERALT: There\\'s clearly magic in the trinket, but I doubt it\\'ll deflect swords or arrows...DESBRUT: Shit, I knew it. I told you so, you idiot...DESBRUT: Screw honor. Don your metal, Newboy, you\\'ll go into battle confessional and all.KENNET: So be it, though I\\'d like to have fleeced the noble. Damn shame...Where did you get this?GERALT: Where did you get this talisman?KENNET: We came by it, let\\'s say...KENNET: We were on patrol, see, and ran into a couple of novice priestesses praying at this shrine... They were nice, smiling and all...DESBRUT: We done wanted to take them two on patrol, ooooh, but...!KENNET: Shut it! Boholt had one of his rare moments of clairvoyance, went rummaging in the shrine and found the amulet...DESBRUT: Who knows what goes on in that head of his, but every now and then he wakes up as good old Boholt.KENNET: Aye, he still cuts \\'em down with a single wallop. In any case, we took the amulet and went off to find the rest of the patrol. Ah, the wonders we saw! First ran into some Squirrels, vicious ones, arrows flyin\\' everywhere, but we came through untouched... Barely three of the others still standing when a dragon swooped down, the elves fell to their knees, and we all legged it. The amulet\\'s magic for certain...GERALT: Though it failed to protect the shrine from your patrolling...KENNET: Aye, true. Well, now we dunno what to think.I\\'d say the amulet could help you.[Same as \"The amulet could help.\"]It\\'s infused with magic, though what kind, I don\\'t know.[Same as \"I doubt it.\"]Seems to me the amulet brings trouble.GERALT: Who knows. Maybe the amulet is unlucky, maybe it draws trouble. I doubt you left the shrine untouched... Then the Scoia\\'tael, the dragon...DESBRUT: I told you as much! We need to get the boy some plate!KENNET: Wait a minute. We owe the witcher some thanks....DESBRUT: But we\\'re broke as shit peddlers...KENNET: Fancy the amulet, witcher? It might draw trouble, be cursed in some way, but you might lift the curse, sell it off...All right.GERALT: I\\'ll take it.KENNET: It\\'s all yours.No chance.GERALT: I have problems enough as it is.DESBRUT: Witcher, you available for normal business still? Willin\\' to hunt monsters?GERALT: Yeah, I\\'m willin\\'. Why do you ask?DESBRUT: Well, cos we were out with those scouts that saw the dragon... No one believes us, but...KENNET: They\\'re sounding the assembly... That\\'s us. But we\\'ll find you after the battle, witcher.GERALT: Wait...KENNET: Farewell.  2.4 - By the King\\'s Will, continued < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt continues through the camp.]GUARD 2: Go see Foltest, Geralt, \\'fore the fury hits him and he hacks off your head.GUARD 1: Foltest said if you don\\'t hurry, he\\'ll rip your balls off.GUARD 2: And make a witcher\\'s medallion out of \\'em.[Geralt finds Foltest at the top of the hill where the ballistae are firing. Foltest is talking to Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, the Nilfgaardian ambassador.]FOLTEST: A beautiful day for battle! Fear not, Excellency, we\\'re out of range of their arbalists.SHILARD: I\\'m no warrior, Sire, I must admit. I prefer to joust verbally or with a pen, the emissary of peace that I am...FOLTEST: Hogwash! You\\'re the emissary of the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, who spared no blood conquering over a dozen sovereign realms!SHILARD: Thus bringing them laws, culture and peace above all.FOLTEST: Finally! Traitors of the realm boil tar on the walls while you dally with the royal advisor.GERALT: How may I assist you, Sire?FOLTEST: We mount an assault today, and you\\'ll be at my side. Follow me, gentlemen, let\\'s not keep the traitors waiting.[A ballista missile strikes the ground nearby.]SHILARD: Sire, you said we were out of range...FOLTEST: That was a ballista, Excellency. Its arms strengthened with bronze plates and strung with horsehair, it can propel heavy bolts up to a mile away. A deadly and very costly weapon.FOLTEST: An experienced crew can cock and release two bolts each minute. Yet it has one flaw.SHILARD: Your Grace, please take cover!FOLTEST: The recoil of the arms is so strong upon firing...[Another missile strikes, further away.]FOLTEST: ...that the weapon shifts. It simply cannot hit the same spot twice.SHILARD: I had no idea Your Grace was a learned military engineer...FOLTEST: I\\'m not. I gave the baroness those ballistae two years ago, for her birthday...SCARRED SOLDIER: Sire...FOLTEST: What say you, Excellency, of men who live in spite of such wounds?SHILARD: And what say you, Your Grace, of soldiers who inflict them?SCARRED SOLDIER: Those who did this live no more!SHILARD: Master Geralt, I wish to converse with you once the storm of battle has subsided.GERALT: Forgive me, Excellency, but I plan to leave the royal court as soon as possible.SHILARD: Might I know why?GERALT: Too often they take me for someone I\\'m not.FOLTEST: What do they call you, soldier? Wait! You served with me at Brenna and during our foray into the Pontar Valley... Norman Sador. Still an arbalist?NORMAN: Yes, Sire. Fate has not been kind to me.FOLTEST: Hah! Norman Sador, for your years of faithful service to the Crown, I appoint you decurion of the arbalists!FOLTEST: Onwards, gentlemen. No reason to dawdle.SHILARD: Forgive my candor, Your Majesty, but I must ask: What fate awaits the royal bastards when...FOLTEST: They\\'re my children! If I hear \"bastard\" one more time someone will die! Painfully!SHILARD: Your Grace, forgive me, but the laws of succession are irrefutably clear...FOLTEST: Piss on the laws! I\\'ll change them, if need be! Above all, I\\'ll not allow a band of treacherous barons to use my children as their banner.SHILARD: Your Majesty is entirely within his rights.[If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Adda is dead] FOLTEST: Adda is dead. And I have no other children...SHILARD: I see.FOLTEST: This conversation is over, Excellency. Please retire to your tent.[If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Adda alive] FOLTEST: Thanks to Geralt of Rivia, my daughter, Adda, is alive and is now the wife of Radovid of Redania.SHILARD: I see.FOLTEST: I fear you do not, Excellency. The midget king merely awaits my demise.SHILARD: I am certain King Radovid of Redania wishes Your Majesty a long and healthy life.FOLTEST: That wasn\\'t even amusing, Excellency. The old families will never accept a Redanian on my throne. Adda will have to content herself with Redania.SHILARD: I understand - the issue of succession remains unresolved. Your Grace, I request your permission to retire.FOLTEST: You have it.FOLTEST: Black Ones in my camp before a battle - what has the world come to? Nothing would make me happier than returning his shriveled head to Emhyr in a sack... But Triss Merigold insisted I be patient and courteous. Was I?As ever, Sire. GERALT: I couldn\\'t have handled it better myself.FOLTEST: Hah! I always knew you were one of us. And bugger what folk say. They talked about Adda no end...Not quite, Sire. GERALT: Not really. I actually saw His Excellency sweat. But that\\'ll be our secret.FOLTEST: Hah! You brought your sense of humor along.FOLTEST: Have you learned anything about the assassin?He could\\'ve been a witcher. GERALT: Triss did an autopsy. It\\'s possible he was a witcher.FOLTEST: A witcher? What have I ever done to the ploughing witchers? Anything more?GERALT: He had no medallion, but that doesn\\'t mean anything.FOLTEST: Many in your shoes would have withheld that information.FOLTEST: After the battle, Triss will report to me. For now, let us tend to the traitors.Nothing new. [Default if Triss didn\\'t tell you about the autopsy.] GERALT: Nothing new, Sire. A month\\'s passed and we don\\'t know any more than we knew when we began. This investigation\\'s going nowhere...FOLTEST: My agents have learned little, also. But we\\'ll find the culprits, it\\'s just a question of time. Now for the battle.FOLTEST: I want you at my side today.

Besides, children should have a mother.GERALT: I\\'m lost...FOLTEST: It\\'s quite simple. Louisa and I had a bit of a tiff. She made demands I could not fulfill... Understand?GERALT: I think so.FOLTEST: Count Etcheverry, and others, immediately intervened, all noble, all sympathetic. They claimed the evil king would take her children, but they would protect them, even place them on the throne...FOLTEST: And the baroness was duped, her motherly love used. In truth, they desire privileges that would weaken the throne.[At the top of the engine, Foltest stops in front of the assembled soldiers.]FOLTEST: Look alive, men!SOLDIERS: HAIL TO THE KING!FOLTEST: Where the hell are we headed?!SOLDIERS: THE WALLS!FOLTEST: What the fuck do we want?!SOLDIERS: VICTORY!FOLTEST: This I like...!SOLDIERS: [cheering]SOLDIER: Eyes on the bridge!

Aryan La Valette, still with the high ground, taunts the approaching forces.]ARYAN: Desist! Or be put down like the rabid dogs you are!FOLTEST: Aryan La Valette.

It shouldn\\'t be hard if the archers provide cover.FOLTEST: That\\'s the son of Louisa and the old baron, heir to these lands. He\\'s hot-tempered but good with a sword. Be careful.GERALT: I\\'ll try to reason with him.FOLTEST: Cover the witcher![Geralt makes his way alone up to the top of the tower where Aryan is.]ARYAN: Halt! He\\'s mine.ARYAN: The famed Geralt of Rivia. You\\'ve fallen low, witcher. Word has it you\\'re one of the best swordsmen in the north. Time to test that rumor.As you wish.

Surrender and Foltest will treat you and your men with honor.ARYAN: And what guarantee is there that he\\'ll not cut us down to the last?GERALT: None.ARYAN: Foltest defiled my mother. Now he colludes with Nilfgaard.GERALT: The King leads an army, you have but a few brave men and your honor. In a minute, you may lose even those. Choose.ARYAN: Hear that, men? The King sends a witcher and we are to surrender, forgetting the very nature of honor and pride! We must choose - shame, or a witcher\\'s sword...ARYAN: Is that how you would live?

Drop your weapons.ARYAN: Should anything happen to my mother... I shall find you and kill you.[Aryan and his men surrender.]Let\\'s settle this between us. GERALT: This is between us.ARYAN: So be it. Stand back, men!ARYAN: My nanny told me stories about you when I couldn’t sleep. I especially liked the one of Renfri and her rogues.

She\\'s fine – and beautiful as ever.

Silas, you look to this door. Fenn, come with me.FOLTEST: Witcher!GERALT: Your Grace?FOLTEST: I\\'ve a mission for you, one suited to your abilities. Vernon can be persuasive, but he\\'s also hot-tempered, at times losing both his self-control and his subject.FOLTEST: You must try to find this other passage on your own. Succeed and you\\'ll be the envy of all Vizima.Sire, the rebels won\\'t hurt the baroness\\'s children.GERALT: Soldiers loyal to the La Valettes would never harm the baroness\\'s children.FOLTEST: I shall be reassured as to that when I see them, not before. We must act quickly. The rebels are dispersed, in disarray. As dimwitted as they are, I fear they could conclude the children would make good hostages.Maybe we should wait for Vernon?GERALT: Maybe Roche\\'ll get something out of this priest. It\\'s a relatively large town, I could use a hint.FOLTEST: I\\'m counting on him, but time is of the essence. Please explore the area. We seek a tunnel or something similar. Beware of traps, they may have planted some. You\\'re best suited to this, my men lack your skills.I\\'ll see you soon, Sire. [EXIT]GERALT: All right.

Everyone\\'s man.GUARD 2: Personally saw him cut down twenty men in the blink of an eye, so it\\'s no surprise.GUARD 1: Hmm... See him dashing \\'long those walls? Can\\'t rightly say I ever saw his sword, the blade moved so fast.GUARD 2: I thought that beast would tear him to bits when it came out the clouds.GUARD 1: Delayed don\\'t mean denied. Hangman\\'ll do that tomorrow.GUARD 2: Heh, heh, heh, heh...GUARD 1: What say we, uh... teach him a lesson, for what he did to Foltest?GUARD 2: I\\'ll not touch the scum - I\\'d get scurvy.GUARD 1: Right. Hangman\\'ll do it – he\\'s poxy already.[Provoke the guards.]GERALT: Guard! Come here, good man.GUARD 1: Why\\'re you hollerin\\'? Do that again and we\\'ll shut you up.Let me out. GERALT: You got the wrong guy.GUARD 2: You mean you didn\\'t kill Foltest? Holy shit, boys, open the cell! We\\'ve got an innocent man in here.GUARD 1: Ha, ha, ha, ha!GUARD 2: Hope you\\'re that funny during the execution tomorrow.I didn\\'t do it, I swear. GERALT: I\\'m not the murderer. Wetnecking\\'s not my style.GUARD 1: That story won\\'t get you anywhere. They caught you red–handed.GERALT: Untrue. No one saw me do it.GUARD 2: But they\\'ll show up in droves tomorrow - to see your flesh burn in the grip of red hot pincers!What\\'s going to happen to me? GERALT: How long are you going to keep me in here?GUARD 2: Can\\'t wait to see the hangman, eh? Don’t worry, tomorrow\\'s your big day!GUARD 1: I can\\'t wait to see him skinned alive!Brave words, what with these bars between us.  [Plays after picking any 2 options.]GERALT: You wouldn\\'t say that if these bars weren\\'t here.GUARD 2: Is that so? Let\\'s see...[Free yourself.]GERALT: Hey, my manacles fell off. Can you help me get them back on?GUARD 1: The freak\\'s freed himself!GUARD 2: How the devil did he do that?GUARD 1: We\\'ve got to get in there! You go left, I\\'ll go right.[Geralt beats up the guards and makes his way out into the prison. After some time, he comes to someone being tortured. Pathway changes depending on whether Aryan La Valette is alive (2.15.1) or dead (2.15.2).]  2.15.1 - Aryan La Valette: Alive < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[If you go to the right and drop down the trapdoor, Geralt will see Aryan being tortured through a gap in the wall.]EXECUTIONER: Will you sign?ARYAN: Go plough yourself!EXECUTIONER: Anais and Boussy are my children. One signature and you\\'ll hear the poem no more.ARYAN: Never!ARYAN: Aaaaargh...EXECUTIONER: A dog tore into a kitchen, and grabbed a sausage link, a stupid cook took umbrage, and killed him in a blink.ARYAN: Ooooh.EXECUTIONER: Another cook done saw this, wise and good of heart, he made the dog a tombstone and carved this epitaph.ARYAN: None will believe it!EXECUTIONER: A dog tore into a kitchen, and grabbed a sausage link, a stupid cook took umbrage, and killed him in a blink.[Geralt enters the room.]EXECUTIONER: You\\'re early. Appointment\\'s not till tomorrow.GERALT: Sorry, I\\'m in a hurry. You\\'ll see me today.[Geralt kills the executioner and releases Aryan, who falls to the ground.]ARYAN: Sooner expected death than you, witcher.GERALT: I thought about letting the Reaper in first.ARYAN: Why are you here?That\\'s unimportant now. GERALT: We\\'ll talk later. I need to get out of this dungeon and you\\'re going to help me.ARYAN: The La Valettes never leave their debts unsatisfied. Especially ones of honor. And I know these corridors better than anyone.Had a date with the hangman. GERALT: Had a date with the hangman.ARYAN: Why?GERALT: They say I killed Foltest.ARYAN: Shame. I\\'d hoped to do that myself.ARYAN: But tell me – what of my mother? Did Foltest hurt her?He provided her with some protection. GERALT: He ordered the Blue Stripes to guard her like some invaluable treasure. Soon afterward, he was dead himself.ARYAN: But you did not slay him?GERALT: No, Aryan. I didn\\'t kill him.ARYAN: Do you know who did?GERALT: No. But I intend to find out.I don\\'t know. GERALT: Sorry, I have no idea.ARYAN: We should go. We\\'ll start by making our way to the oil store. I cannot walk unaided. You must help me.GERALT: Lean on me.[As they\\'re walking out, they hear voices.]SOLDIER 1: Done with him, hangman?SOLDIER 2: We\\'re to take the corpse!GERALT: Dammit.SOLDIER 1: Hangman\\'s so \"into\" his victim, he can\\'t hear us.[Geralt nudges Aryan.]ARYAN: What the...?GERALT: Shout!ARYAN: Aaaahhhhhh. I will not sign! Never!SOLDIER 2: Ooh, he\\'s a stubborn cocksucker.SOLDIER 1: Best not disturb \\'em. Hangman\\'ll bring him out when he\\'s done.GERALT: I think they bought it. We need to be careful.[If you go the other direction, Geralt instead sees Aryan being led out of the torture chamber by two guards. He manages to knock them out, but collapses, at which point Geralt reveals himself.]GERALT: Stay calm, Aryan.ARYAN: What are you doing here?Same thing as you\\'re doing. GERALT: Same thing as you.ARYAN: Yes, but they imprisoned you. Why?GERALT: They say I killed Foltest.ARYAN: Shame. I\\'d hoped to do that myself.Unimportant. GERALT: Some other time. For now, we have to get out of your castle. Any idea how to do that?ARYAN: Of course.GERALT: Lead the way?ARYAN: You spared my life. The La Valettes never leave their debts unsatisfied. Especially ones of honor.ARYAN: Do you know my mother\\'s fate? Foltest did her no harm?Sorry, I don\\'t know. GERALT: News you can trust is hard to come by in wartime. I\\'ve heard nothing about her.ARYAN: Fortunately, I know how to restore my family\\'s honor.She\\'s fine. Foltest provided her with protection. GERALT: Foltest ordered the Blue Stripes to guard her like some invaluable treasure.ARYAN: Bastard. Placing her among those dogs. One more nobly born should protect her, a baronet at least.GERALT: Time to think about saving your life.ARYAN: To me, honor is more important than life.GERALT: What do you plan to do?ARYAN: Not your concern. We must get to the oil store, where there\\'s a way out.[Geralt and Aryan navigate the prison.]ARYAN: Up the stairs, this way.ARYAN: Second door on the left - that\\'s the oil store.[Aryan reveals a secret passage.]GERALT: Come with me. There\\'s nothing you can do here.ARYAN: I\\'ve more to do now than ever before.GERALT: Alone?ARYAN: I need no one\\'s aid for what I aim to accomplish.GERALT: Is that your final word?ARYAN: Farewell, witcher.[Geralt takes the secret passage, and behind him Aryan sets the oil barrels on fire.]  2.15.2 - Aryan La Valette: Dead < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[If you go to the right and drop down the trapdoor, Geralt will see Baroness Louisa La Valette being tortured through a gap in the wall.]LOUISA: You would not dare!EXECUTIONER: I\\'m just following orders, m\\'Lady.LOUISA: Who issued them?EXECUTIONER: What\\'s more important is what they require of me.LOUISA: And what\\'s that?EXECUTIONER: One little signature confirming that Foltest did not sire your little bastards.LOUISA: I shall sign whatever you wish.EXECUTIONER: Of course you will, m\\'Lady. All succumb sooner or later.LOUISA: Please... Not the iron, there\\'s no need for the iron. I\\'ll do what you wish.EXECUTIONER: There\\'s a right time for everything. Now\\'s the time for the hot iron.LOUISA: I beg you...EXECUTIONER: Then we\\'ll take some wedges to your nails, and finish off with spoons to the eyes. Hmmm... Only then - spent, your will broken for good - shall you sign what the scribe has prepared and have no desire to retract your confession.LOUISA: Aaagh...EXECUTIONER: Can\\'t wait for it, eh, you harlot? Won\\'t be long now. Just warmin\\' up my poker.[Geralt breaks into the room and kills the executioner.]LOUISA: I am at your mercy, witcher. What now?GERALT: Cover yourself, m\\'Lady.[Geralt turns away from her as Louisa fixes her dress.]LOUISA: In better times, the King spoke to me of you... You must look me in the eyes when you answer: Did you slay Foltest?GERALT: No.LOUISA: Hmmmm.... I suppose I must believe you. You should be glad. I\\'d have to gouge out those devil\\'s eyes otherwise.GERALT: I am glad, m\\'Lady. I like my eyes.LOUISA: Where are my children?GERALT: Forgive me, but I just escaped my cell and can\\'t count myself among the well-informed.LOUISA: Then you are at my mercy. I know this dungeon better than anyone. Your chances of escaping are nil without my help, slim with it.GERALT: I\\'ll gladly take slim.LOUISA: In that case, let us go. Along the way, you can tell me how my son, Aryan La Valette, died...[Before they can leave the room, Shilard and two Nilfgaardian soldiers enter.]SHILARD: They never miss. They\\'re the elite of the Nilfgaardian army.They look like show dancers. GERALT: You\\'re kidding, right? There are only two of them.SHILARD: Holding two of the best crossbows in the world.Here for the interrogation? GERALT: Your Excellency - here to oversee the interrogation?SHILARD: I have come to assist the Baroness La Valette, former mistress of this castle. But I see she has found her champion already.LOUISA: What do you want, Excellency?SHILARD: To aid you, m\\'Lady. Or rather, to present a proposal.LOUISA: The La Valettes have never made and will never make a pact with Nilfgaard.SHILARD: Panta rei, Baroness. There are no constants in this world. It is time to adapt to the new order. Particularly now that Aryan and the King are no more. You and the royal children require protection.LOUISA: Where are they?SHILARD: In the upper castle. They are safe, unhurt thus far. I can guarantee their further safety and yours provided you can agree to Imperial protection, stomach, as it were, Nilfgaardians in your presence. Naturally, I expect nothing in return.LOUISA: You contradict yourself, Ambassador, your ruse is not lost on me. But so be it. Now, take me to my children.GERALT: I hadn\\'t planned on going to the upper castle.SHILARD: And rightly so. Many there tremble with anticipation for tomorrow\\'s execution. I must resolve a few \\'administrative\\' matters to deliver the Baroness from this oppression, and I will occupy, for ample time, I think, the guards at the main dungeon gate in the process. M\\'Lady, I leave you in the hands of this honorable knight. Witcher, count twenty heartbeats and follow me.GERALT: Why would you aid a kingslayer, Excellency?SHILARD: I aid a witcher who may find the real regicide. I\\'m a principled man who abhors all acts of violence, in addition to which the Empire I represent needs a stable North. But we digress. Twenty heartbeats, then follow.When I faced Aryan, I had no choice. GERALT: M\\'Lady, your son Aryan gave me no choice...LOUISA: I know. Stubborn to the last as the La Valettes have always been. I trust he did not suffer...?GERALT: I doubt he even sensed the final blow coming.LOUISA: There\\'s that, at least. You have spoken your piece, witcher. Go.As usual, the ambassador is playing his games. GERALT: I wouldn\\'t trust him, m\\'Lady.LOUISA: Do you believe I have a choice, witcher? By your estimation, how is it I find myself imprisoned now? The old families led by Kimbolt and Maravel wish to reap all they can for themselves. They dream of one of their own donning the crown, and my children are but an impediment. We require protection, and the Nilfgaardian knows this well. It is time. Go, witcher.[If you go the other direction away from the trapdoor, Geralt instead witnesses two Nilfgaardian soldiers bring Louisa out into the hall where Shilard is waiting.]SHILARD: I am Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, emissary of the Empire of Nilfgaard and its most divine Emperor Emhyr var Emreis...LOUISA: What do you want of me, Nilfgaardian?SHILARD: Simply to speak, m\\'Lady.LOUISA: Ah, really...? Something you would not dare were my son still alive.SHILARD: I very much regret the death of the Baron La Valette. Please accept my deepest condolences. Yet it is precisely his loss that renders our conversation mutually desirable.LOUISA: Let go of me! I shall walk unaided. [Towards door of torture chamber] I shall return, rogue! And I shall repay you!SHILARD: Let us go, m\\'Lady. Your cries can do us no good.[Geralt makes his way to a room where Shilard and Louisa are talking.]SHILARD: The La Valettes are a powerful dynasty, as the Emperor is fully aware.LOUISA: What do you and your emperor want?SHILARD: To take care of you, m\\'Lady. And your progeny, of course.LOUISA: Selflessly?SHILARD: That was unnecessary.[Geralt opens the door.]SHILARD: Come in, Master Geralt. Allow me to introduce the Baroness La Valette, mother to the royal children, who at present mourns the passing of her eldest son...GERALT: M\\'Lady.SHILARD: I comfort the baroness with assurances that House La Valette need suffer no more, its future brighter as it stands protected by the Empire of Nilfgaard.LOUISA: Did you kill my son Aryan?He gave me no choice. GERALT: I had no choice. He knew what can happen once swords are drawn and begin to swing. He chose death over shame.LOUISA: Stubborn like his father and grandfather before him. Honor above all. How did he die? Did he suffer?GERALT: No, I doubt he felt the final blow, didn\\'t even see it coming.LOUISA: There\\'s that, I suppose.Many perished in this war, not just your son. GERALT: M\\'lady, I killed many during the assault, not just your son. War demands sacrifices - you might remember that the next time you\\'re about to start one.SHILARD: Have some compassion, Master Geralt. The baroness requires support, she is distraught as it is...LOUISA: Unnecessary toil, Excellency, for witchers have no feelings. And the truth, especially when painful, can wake us from the slumber of self-deception. I deserved as much.[Continues the same as \"Your son despised Nilfgaard.\"]Your son despised Nilfgaard. GERALT: M\\'Lady, I wouldn\\'t trust the ambassador if I were you.SHILARD: Master Geralt, let us be serious, please...LOUISA: Let him speak. I wish to hear this.GERALT: I didn\\'t know your son, but I know he saw the Empire as a foe. As did King Foltest.LOUISA: You\\'ve no notion of the events transpiring in the kingdom, of what Kimbolt, Maravel and their ilk are capable. My duty is to Foltest\\'s children, their safety. And though I, too, see a pact with Nilfgaard as a pact with the devil, I feel I have no choice. Besides, can you say that you really knew the King?GERALT: Well enough to be confident of my words.LOUISA: Truly? In that case, what kind of a man was he? I wish to know your view.He was tough and ruthless - a good king. GERALT: He was ruthless, hard and effective. A good king.LOUISA: Effectiveness is the mark of a good witcher. We\\'ve learned to expect other things from monarchs - say, justice and wisdom...GERALT: Few are born wise, m\\'Lady. He did all he could to preserve and safeguard the realm.He was like any other man, except born to wear a crown. GERALT: He laughed at pleasantries, envied those better than him, feared those stronger, despised the weaker, and killed those he hated... Those he loved, he presented with ballistae... He was a man like any other, except he was born to be king.LOUISA: True, he was a boor in a crown...SHILARD: M\\'Lady!LOUISA: And that was the first and last honest epitaph he\\'ll get. Once the poets start in, nothing will remain of the real Foltest.SHILARD: M\\'Lady, you will set down your memoirs - I shall make that my mission... Once we bring in the appropriate artist...LOUISA: Later, Excellency. All in due time.I\\'m not one to judge. GERALT: M\\'Lady, those of my profession generally live longer by not judging the nobly born. Especially crowned heads they\\'re accused of murdering...LOUISA: If there\\'s any truth to the accusation, you stand to lose nothing by speaking.GERALT: I didn\\'t kill Foltest. What\\'s more, I intend to find the man who did.He used everything and everyone. GERALT: Conceit, greed, lechery, anger... All the human demons gorged themselves on Foltest. Though those traits might\\'ve issued more from the office than the man. Who knows...SHILARD: Master Geralt, I\\'ve hitherto disregarded the rumors of you being a monster slayer and philosopher in equal measures... Yet a philosopher you are, and a subversive one at that...LOUISA: The ambassador questioned your guilt... It seems now that I, too, believe you did not slay the King.LOUISA: Your Excellency, you will aid the witcher to escape the castle. That is my wish.SHILARD: But M\\'Lady, this would represent an immeasurable risk in my estimation. And there is the matter of your son...LOUISA: He chose his fate and departed in a manner worthy of the La Valettes. How am I to believe you\\'ll protect me from reptiles like Kimbolt and Maravel when you balk at the notion of deceiving a few prison guards?SHILARD: M\\'Lady, I shall do what is in my power. Give me a moment, witcher, then proceed to the main gate. [Geralt leaves. As Geralt makes his way out of the castle, Shilard distracts the guards.]  2.16 - the riverboat < PREV CONTENTS[Geralt exits the castle. If Newboy wore the amulet into battle and was killed, Geralt finds his corpse outside.]GERALT: The young Reaver of Crinfrid... a lot of good that amulet did him.[If Newboy wore armor into battle and survived, Geralt meets him when he exits the castle.]NEWBOY: Halt! Blimey, is that you, witcher? They say you killed the King.GERALT: Well, I didn\\'t. And I\\'m going to prove it.NEWBOY: I\\'m inclined to believe you.GERALT: Glad to hear that. It\\'d be pretty stupid if I had to kill you now. Did all the Reavers survive the assault?NEWBOY: Aye, they\\'ve been drinkin\\' themselves silly for two days now. I believe I owe you something.GERALT: You don\\'t owe me a thing.NEWBOY: We wound up in a boiling cauldron during the assault... You know how it is when knights get caught in a tight passage. Nowhere to go - those in the back push forward, those in the front are stuck, and halberd blows raining down from above... I\\'d\\'ve been crushed if not for my armor.NEWBOY: And about ten blows landed on my helmet. My ears still ring and I puke time and again, but I live and breathe.GERALT: Concussion. It\\'ll pass.Were you with the Reavers in that Scoia\\'tael ambush?GERALT: Were you on patrol with the Reavers when they ran into those Scoia\\'tael?NEWBOY: Aye.GERALT: Kennet mentioned the unit was especially vicious. Notice anything out of the ordinary? A unit emblem or something?NEWBOY: Right you are. They had masks made of the cloth of Special Forces uniforms... And they hollered a lot - \\'Iorveth\\' or some such.GERALT: Mhm. Where did the dragon come from?NEWBOY: I\\'ve no idea, but it saved our arses. The elves ceased shooting at the sight of it... Can\\'t tell you anymore, as we fled right then as if the devil himself was on our tail.NEWBOY: Take this. Kennet told me to study up, but I\\'ve not the mind for it. Just not cut out to be a dragon hunter, I guess. It could be useful to you, though.[Newboy gives Geralt the book \"About Dragons\".]See you. [EXIT]GERALT: I need to go.NEWBOY: There are sentries on the dike - no way you\\'ll slip through.GERALT: Can you distract them?NEWBOY: Um, I\\'ll try. But remember: count me out if there\\'s a fight... In fact, we could end up foes.GERALT: I hope not. Go.NEWBOY: Just give me a minute.[Geralt makes his way down to the river boat where Roche and Triss await.][If Aryan La Valette was alive]ROCHE: Bloody hell, you didn\\'t have to torch the castle...[If any guards were killed]ROCHE: You were to sneak out, avoid anything resembling a blood bath.GERALT: You left me the key to my manacles, not an invisibility cloak.[If no guards were killed]ROCHE: Peace and quiet - I\\'m impressed. The boys were betting you\\'d turn the dungeon into another Blaviken.GERALT: Can we sail? That peace and quiet might disappear irretrievably at any moment.GERALT: Triss, is everything all right?TRISS: Not exactly. I\\'m no longer the royal adviser... I\\'ve lost my post, my home in Vizima... Witcher\\'s mistress, they call me... Kingslayer\\'s whore...Politics can be brutal...GERALT: Triss, you put yourself out there...[If Geralt killed the executioner: Aryan alive]GERALT: I ran into a hangman torturing Aryan La Valette, trying to force him to confess to incestuous relations with his mother. Foltest\\'s children were to be Aryan\\'s.TRISS: Sons of bitches.GERALT: The hangman has hanged his last.[If Geralt killed the executioner: Aryan dead]GERALT: I ran into a hangman torturing Louisa La Valette, trying to force her to confess to incestuous relations with her son. Foltest\\'s children were to be Aryan\\'s.TRISS: Sons of bitches.GERALT: The hangman has hanged his last, but Shilard has the baroness and her children.We\\'ll clear our names.GERALT: People say what they think they have to.TRISS: I know, but...GERALT: They\\'ll change their minds as soon as we find the kingslayer. Roche\\'ll see to that. Right, spy?ROCHE: I\\'m no spy, but you\\'re mostly correct.ROCHE: An interregnum is chaos by definition. Rats like Baron Kimbolt and Count Maravel rule Temeria now, or strive to. But no one save old Natalis can restore true order...TRISS: Natalis is far away and of low birth. The crown\\'s simply out of his reach. Baron Kimbolt on the other hand....GERALT: Politics is secondary right now... Vernon, learn anything new about the kingslayer?ROCHE: A week ago, I got a message from an informer in Flotsam. He saw Iorveth in the company of a large, bald man, not unlike the one you described.GERALT: A week ago? Sounds like a cold trail to me.ROCHE: We need to start somewhere. The trading post is a few days up river, in the forests that lie on the Aedirnian border. Iorveth\\'s territory.GERALT: Flotsam it is, then.GERALT: Triss.TRISS: Yes?GERALT: I\\'m a bit beat up. Will you look at my wounds?TRISS: Mhm...GERALT: Let\\'s go below deck. And I need you to tell me about Yennefer, in detail.

Quickly and to the point. The arachas will soon return and I’d rather know all before then.LETHO: I can add several more heads to this one. Each crowned.IORVETH: Go on.LETHO: Foltest to start with. I barely escaped in Aedirn. I’ll need help - access to your hideouts and maps of your secret trails... And the support of the Scoia\\'tael... I want no gold and have no interest in a killer’s fame.IORVETH: Then why do you wish them dead?LETHO: It’s a long story... Your beast nabbed his nekker. Time to go.

Jump.TRISS: Come on already![Geralt, Triss, and Roche begin following the riverbank to Flotsam.]TRISS: Any news from your secret informer?ROCHE: The port\\'s blocked. Some merchants have been held up for months.TRISS: What about roads through the forest...?ROCHE: Iorveth rules the forest.ROCHE: Where are we?TRISS: In a forest?ROCHE: Very funny. But who does it belong to?TRISS: Iorveth, maybe? I know more about the Pontar Valley than you think. For instance, I know that Foltest stole this land from Demavend a few years back. I believe you had a hand in that?GERALT: Hear that?ROCHE: I smell an elf.ROCHE: Foltest had just as much right to this land as Demavend.TRISS: Right? Or do you mean might?ROCHE: True, there were some skirmishes. Altogether a pleasant foray - experienced fighters only. No peasant footmen or frivolous lords. None of that circus... Ah, you wouldn\\'t understand...[The sound of flute music begins. A short distance down the bank, they find an elf on a fallen log playing the flute.]ROCHE: That\\'s...IORVETH: Vernon Roche!

You\\'ve fallen low...IORVETH: A hired killer, true. But in all certainty, he is no dh\\'oine.GERALT: Don\\'t make a big deal of the race thing...IORVETH: Yet race is the very reason we fight! We have pointed ears, yours are rounded. We are few, yet long-lived, your kind multiplies like vermin, though thankfully expires quickly... Humans and elves alike, trying to prove one shape is better than the other. Four hundred years of killing over the mold of the auricle.I\\'ve heard enough of your philosophy. GERALT: You\\'re just another old elf in a young elf\\'s skin, using clever words to mask an obvious truth.IORVETH: Obvious you say?GERALT: This is not about race or freedom. Or even vengeance. You\\'re here because someone powerful told you to be. Someone who\\'s using you. They may wear a crown, carry a magic wand, or even lead a guild... But be sure of this: it\\'s not about your freedom, your rights, or your ears. Nilfgaard ploughed you once, now someone new does. Am I wrong?IORVETH: Those times are gone...

GERALT: We need him alive. Know any useful spells?TRISS: Get his attention, I need to focus.GERALT: I\\'ll try.ROCHE: Climb down and we\\'ll finish this. I await.IORVETH: Hah! You\\'re a man without honor, Vernon Roche. An insect I\\'ll not duel, but one that I will crush.GERALT: Seems like you spout the same old elven drivel.IORVETH: What do you mean, witcher?GERALT: I\\'ve seen your kind before. Proud Aen Seidhe sneaking around forests. Helpless, yet masking that with acts of increasing cruelty.IORVETH: I helped kill Roche\\'s king. You call that helpless? Or would you call me a terrorist? No one will grant us our freedom, witcher. We must win it for ourselves.[Continues the same as \"I\\'ve heard enough of your philosophy.\"]Where\\'s your unit?GERALT: Where\\'s your unit?

Stay close!TRISS: What\\'s... what\\'s happening?ROCHE: Triss is spent, so no more butterflies. Let\\'s get the fuck out of here.GERALT: Back to the boat?ROCHE: There\\'s even more of them that way. We must fight our way toward Flotsam.TRISS: Is that you, Roche?! Get your hands off my ass!ROCHE: Who did you think it was?TRISS: I\\'m not a sack of flour or one of your commandos. I\\'m a woman!ROCHE: I noticed.TRISS: Ugh. I\\'m going to be sick...[Roche carries Triss as Geralt fights the oncoming Scoia\\'tael.]ROCHE: At least I\\'ll die holding a lovely arse!TRISS: Not mine! I\\'ll hold the spell...ROCHE: Come on! Let\\'s go!TRISS: Stop shaking! I need to focus!ROCHE: Are you all right?TRISS: Yes, fine.ROCHE: Grrrrrr... Sons of bitches...TRISS: What\\'s happening? All I see are your boots.ROCHE: Where the hell is that trading post?ROCHE: I\\'m starting to think we\\'ll make it. Wait, the barrier\\'s waning...

Letho comes up next to Iorveth.]IORVETH: You know each other?LETHO: Rather well, but he has amnesia. I actually took the witcher by surprise when I killed Foltest. Fear not, elf. I know Geralt, I know his weakness.[At the edge of Flotsam, Geralt and company regroup.]TRISS: Too many spells at once. You can die from that...ROCHE: See that?GERALT: Yeah, the kingslayer and Iorveth.FLOTSAM GUARD: You all in one piece? Who are you?GERALT: I\\'m a witcher.ROCHE: Emhyr var Emreis, spice merchant.FLOTSAM GUARD: A trader?ROCHE: In spices.FLOTSAM GUARD: Uh-huh... And the woman?TRISS: My good man, we barely escaped death... Be so kind as to tell us where we might get some rest. We\\'ll explain everything later.FLOTSAM GUARD: Very well. Head for the market square. You might be in time for the execution... Some ne\\'er-do-wells are going to hang - a dwarf and some bard. There\\'s also an inn and a brothel...TRISS: Oh yeah, the brothel sounds especially interesting.

Blue Stripes, the nonhuman hunters.ROCHE: Precisely. Anyone suspected of collaborating with the Scoia\\'tael falls under my jurisdiction.GERALT: And Dandelion? What\\'s he accused of?LOREDO: He burned down a watchtower. What\\'s your jurisdiction say to that? I thought so.GERALT: Is that true?DANDELION: It might\\'ve looked that way... But I swear it wasn\\'t my fault!I don\\'t want trouble. GERALT: Your people started it. Short fuses, some of them.LOREDO: What do I care? They started, but you finished.GERALT: I had to defend my friends. Will you release them?LOREDO: Terrible choice of friends, witcher.Who are you? GERALT: Are you in command here?LOREDO: Forgive me! Bernard Loredo, Commander of Port Flotsam. Yes, I rule this brothel... The law\\'s on our side. [Same as above.]I don\\'t want trouble. [Same as above.]LOREDO: I\\'d rather give you a thief. Relax, I\\'m joking... I hate thieves. We can put on another show - bloody and serious this time, mind you - or we can come to an understanding.GERALT: Meaning?LOREDO: Give me a minute, witcher.LOREDO: Listen here. You may have heard rumors of the tragic events that transpired during the siege of La Valette Castle. Sadly, they are true. King Foltest is dead. It\\'s likely that Scoia\\'tael had a hand in this heinous murder. So, you see, none of you can feel safe. That is why today, wagons with armaments will roll out into Flotsam\\'s streets. I hereby declare a state of emergency. Await orders, prepare to fight, and ready yourselves to avenge your fallen king. Now disperse, go to your homes.Dandelion and Zoltan are free? GERALT: What about them?LOREDO: They\\'ll not hang for now. Let\\'s say I\\'m reconsidering their cases... The scaffold\\'s no place for civil conversation. We\\'ll talk at my home. Your friends are free for the time being, but they\\'re not to leave town.LOREDO: Come after dusk. Hm, I\\'ll be busy until then. There\\'s one more thing...LOREDO: Welcome to Flotsam, witcher.Nice show. GERALT: Nice speech. You might as well have said outright that nonhumans slew Foltest...LOREDO: My subjects know exactly who their enemy is. Out in that forest, grow careless for a moment and you\\'re a dead man.GERALT: Whereas the nonhumans here in town are all friendly.LOREDO: Friendlier than the merciless bastards out there. We let the Scoia\\'tael inside and they\\'ll skin us alive, just before they slit our throats. Here, even the slightest sense of safety is an illusion. We\\'ll not succumb to it for a moment.[Continues the same as \"Dandelion and Zoltan are free?\"][Dandelion and Zoltan are freed from the nooses.]DANDELION: Ah. They were really going to hang us. I... I... I don\\'t know... I didn\\'t mean to torch that watchtower.GERALT: Everything\\'s all right, Dandelion. Let\\'s get out of here.ZOLTAN: Oh we owe, we owe you, Geralt. Thank you.ZOLTAN: Time to hit the tavern. Come on, Dandelion, you need a stiff drink. And while we\\'re at it, I\\'ll tell you an edifying tale of local hypocrisy that conceals lechery \\'neath a veneer of courtesy. Except nothing can hide the stench.[Geralt joins his friends in the tavern.]DANDELION: Ha-hah! Damn, that was close... Innkeep! Vodka!ZOLTAN: Triss Merigold! Lice eat me, but you are a treat to behold! Ah, just a little pale...TRISS: Magic takes its toll, but I\\'ll be all right. Good to see you and your beard again.GERALT: Can somebody tell me what happened? You set off a month ago for Zoltan\\'s wedding...ZOLTAN: That got fucked. There will be no wedding.GERALT: Did you hear about Foltest?DANDELION: Rumors travel faster than the wind.ZOLTAN: Winds and rumors! I want to know the truth.DANDELION: I want to know how Foltest died. And the dragon - was there really one there? And who rules Temeria now?GERALT: Dandelion, calm down - you\\'ll choke on your liquor.The dragon... GERALT: The dragon... Well, the dragon appeared, and that\\'s all I know.DANDELION: But where did the La Valettes get a dragon?! We heard it fought on their side! Huge as a barn, they say.GERALT: Dragons don\\'t usually take sides. Maybe its lair was nearby and it just felt threatened.TRISS: If you hadn\\'t driven it off, Foltest might not have taken the castle.GERALT: Maybe. We\\'ll never know for sure.What\\'s with the wedding, Zoltan? GERALT: No wedding, Zoltan?ZOLTAN: Hah! The Breckenriggs broke off the engagement because some limp prick put it about that I joined the uprising in Vizima. My would-be pop-in-law refused to let a rebel firebrand join the family... Innkeep! Where\\'s our drink?!DANDELION: It was like this... We got to Mahakam a week after the Grand Master died. Bought Zoltan an absolutely grand doublet, a pair of Geribuldi crackowes and, as a gift for Eudora, a jadestone as big as my fist.ZOLTAN: We were broke as a joke by the time Dandelion threw me a bachelor party at an establishment called \\'The Tight Lane.\\'DANDELION: Next day we went over to the Breckenriggs\\'. They welcomed us in, sat us down, and proceeded to discuss the superiority of Mahakaman mining know-how over any other. And that went on until dinner. Just when I thought I\\'d learned more than I ever wanted to know about mining, they served the soup...ZOLTAN: You could\\'ve heard a pin drop. Old Breckenrigg rose and he says, \\'A real dwarf works a mine, not chases fame on the battlefield.\\'DANDELION: You\\'ll never believe this, Geralt, but they served duck blood soup! It was as black as tar. They must\\'ve dropped lumps of coal into the pot.ZOLTAN: Eat,\\' Breckenrigg says, then proceeded to slurp two full bowls of the shite. Old goat. Hope his mine caves in on his head.Dandelion, since when have you worked for Roche? GERALT: Since when have you worked for Roche?DANDELION: Hey, nobody said a word when you went out to save Temeria from the Grand Master and his mutants.GERALT: Relax, Dandelion. I was just asking. Do what you want. You\\'re an adult... kind of.ZOLTAN: Bua-ha-ha-ha-haaaaa-ha!TRISS: That wasn\\'t very supportive.DANDELION: Laugh away... At least I decided to do something constructive.GERALT: You used to spy for Redania, now you\\'re spying for Temeria. Some might call you a traitor.DANDELION: Ever tried to live off of poetry alone? The truth is, I\\'m a citizen of the world. As long as I don\\'t serve Emperor Emhyr, I\\'m not doing any harm.ZOLTAN: Leave him be, Geralt. He\\'ll play the spy a bit, get bored, and drop it. You know how he is.Have you joined the Scoia\\'tael, Zoltan? GERALT: Loredo said you\\'re working with the Scoia\\'tael, Zoltan.ZOLTAN: I have done many things in my life, Geralt, but I\\'ve never stooped to banditry.GERALT: The Scoia\\'tael don\\'t consider themselves bandits.ZOLTAN: But I am no Scoia\\'tael.Triss, tell us what happened after I was arrested. GERALT: Triss, you\\'re the expert on Temeria... tell us who\\'s in charge now.TRISS: It\\'s chaotic and getting worse. The old families are fighting for supremacy, no holds barred.DANDELION: Baron Kimbolt and Count Maravel, I bet...TRISS: Among others. After the assassination, while Geralt was in the dungeon, the lords convened in a field near La Valette Castle to choose a new ruler. Three days they debated and it looked more like a bazaar than a meeting of nobles. Except the trade was in court and ministry positions, spheres of influence, royal privileges...ZOLTAN: Thah! Humans!TRISS: In spite of several duels and two poisonings, no king was chosen. Civil war was in the air.No mages around to cool things down? GERALT: Where were the mages?ZOLTAN: Aye! Where were the gray eminences of this world when they were truly needed?TRISS: They weren\\'t invited. Neither was I. But if not for their intervention, or rather that of a few influential sorceresses, Baron Kimbolt would\\'ve taken the throne...DANDELION: I was invited to sing at his court once. Afterwards, he refused to pay me, and the food was awful. No way I\\'ll stay in Temeria if he\\'s crowned.Was there any resolution? GERALT: Did they ultimately resolve anything?TRISS: No. It ended as usual...Sadly, John Natalis remains our only hope.DANDELION: Ah, the victor at Brenna and Foltest\\'s most tried and true field commander.TRISS: Hmm. During the deliberations, he was several days\\' march from La Valette lands - with an additional two thousand armed men in tow. He\\'s to keep the peace until a rightful monarch is chosen.DANDELION: He could find that ruling is to his liking.TRISS: Natalis is a soldier at heart. He\\'s not suited to rule and I don\\'t believe he even wants to.ZOLTAN: He\\'s got the army behind him...TRISS: Which is why he can guarantee peace. A tenuous one, sure, but that\\'s always better than civil war. Besides which, he\\'s deeply in debt to a dwarven bank in which Philippa Eilhart, a sorceress, holds a significant stake.That\\'s enough politics. About the King... GERALT: Foltest\\'s killer lay in wait in the tower where the La Valettes had hidden the royal bastards. He was well-informed.DANDELION: Wait a minute. What were you doing there?GERALT: I was protecting the King. After the first attempt, Foltest began treating me as his lucky charm. He ordered me to be at his side during the battle. The dragon separated us from the rest of the army. The killer disguised himself as a monk, a blind one at that. He let Foltest greet his children, waited until I had walked off, then cut the king\\'s throat from ear to ear.ZOLTAN: How did he flee?GERALT: Jumped out a window into the river below. Iorveth\\'s Scoia\\'tael were waiting in a boat - it was planned.DANDELION: And you\\'re chasing him because he murdered the King?GERALT: I was accused of the murder. I need to clear my name. Besides, I looked him in the eye before he escaped... He\\'s a witcher. Then some brave Temerian soldiers showed up, piled on me, and knocked me out...[A man bursts into the tavern.]MAN: Save yourselves, good folk! The beast attacks!TRISS: We better get out there... Someone\\'s casting spells.[A tentacle writhes around the docks, striking bystanders. A mage casts a lightning spell at it, and it retreats.]DOCK WORKER: What sort of sorceress are you?! A lot of good you did. Can\\'t you hear me?! Why didn\\'t you help him?SÍLE: He\\'s alive, isn\\'t he?DOCK WORKER: The beast nearly pulled him in the water, while you stood staring like a calf at a shit-covered clover!SÍLE: Watch your words.[Geralt and Triss approach.]GERALT: Where\\'s this beast?DOCK WORKER: Ask her!SÍLE: Geralt?GERALT: Ah, I guess we knew each other.DOCK WORKER: Oh, lookey here, birds of a feather...SÍLE: Let\\'s say... I\\'ve heard of you.DOCK WORKER: Master witcher, this is foolish. The beast near pulled Sosek into the depths, and you\\'re simply chatting with this damsel!Butt out. Sosek\\'s alive, isn\\'t he? GERALT: Sosek\\'s alive and nowhere near the depths. The monster\\'s vanished without a trace.DOCK WORKER: You best take us seriously, lest you vanish without a trace.Right. About the monster... GERALT: All right. What happened?SÍLE: I came to Flotsam to kill the kayran.DOCK WORKER 2: Kayran?SÍLE: The monster that has effectively blocked the port. A moment ago, I had the good fortune to see it in all its splendor, but the local folk scared it away.DOCK WORKER 3: Good fortune? You hear that, Sosek? That was some good fortune for you!DOCK WORKER 2: Why\\'s the beast in the port all of a sudden, eh? Summoned by the witch, perchance?DOCK WORKER 1: To see it in all its splendor!Care to fight the monster yourselves? GERALT: And which of you is ready to help the sorceress fight the beast?DOCK WORKER 2: Why us? Huge it is! Big as a mountain!GERALT: Then why get angry at someone who\\'s willing?DOCK WORKER 2: Well, \\'cause...GERALT: We\\'ll tend to the kayran, the sorceress or I. Maybe we\\'ll do it together. We\\'ll draw it away from the port beforehand, so as not to endanger the likes of you.DOCK WORKER 1: Well, I hope you succeed. I\\'ve no preference for who does it - witch or witcher... just kill the whoreson and the whole town will be grateful.[INTIMIDATION] Get out of my face. GERALT: I\\'m tired of your whining.

About the monster...\"][A man in fine clothing approaches.]MERSE: I apologize for interrupting, but I am Louis Merse, and I am chief person in charge of all matters related to monster-hunting in Flotsam. It is in this capacity that I must inquire if you\\'re willing to attempt to resolve the problem of our so-called kayran - the beast that now blocks all trade traffic on the river.SÍLE: So, witcher? Are we willing?GERALT: I usually work alone...SÍLE: I was here first, and I\\'ll not relinquish this contract. My way or the highway, as the locals put it...GERALT: Fine, your way it is.MERSE: You must contact the merchants on the waterfront as regards any rewards. Madame De Tansarville has, I believe, already conducted some preliminary negotiations...SÍLE: That, I have.MERSE: In that case, don\\'t let me keep you.[Merse leaves.]SÍLE: Triss, how long must I wait for you to introduce us?TRISS: Síle de Tansarville, advisor to Queen Zulika of Kovir.GERALT: Kovir\\'s a long way north.SÍLE: True. I had my doubts if the kayran was worth the journey, but those were dispelled with what it showed today.TRISS: Here to hunt down some ingredients?SÍLE: Triss Merigold - sharp as ever.GERALT: You\\'re thinking that...?SÍLE: Troll eyes, ghoul venom, virgins\\' blood... All those disgusting marvels we take from dying species... To throw into the cauldron at sabbaths. Right, Triss?TRISS: Absolutely - virgins are a dying breed.SÍLE: Oh my! Your sense of humor seems to be intact, too. But enough of these pleasantries. Tell me,GERALT: you saw the tentacle - what do you make of it all?GERALT: The beast must be huge. Maybe inhabited one of the Pontar\\'s tributaries before, hunting animals... Then it grew for some reason and hunger drove it to seek fresh pastures.SÍLE: And on the Pontar it found trade barges burgeoning with obese, slow-moving merchants. You\\'re partly correct. Cedric claims the kayran emerged from the northern swamps approximately one month past.[If Cedric hasn\\'t been met yet] GERALT: Cedric?SÍLE: An elf... Formerly a Scoia\\'tael. Strange bird, but he knows quite a bit about the area and its living wonders.GERALT: I need to look around, find out a few things...SÍLE: Hm, an investigation, witchers\\' rituals, extracting secrets and such...GERALT: More or less. I\\'ll talk to the merchants about the reward, pay Cedric a visit and get back to you...SÍLE: You\\'ll find me at the inn. I\\'ve rented lodgings there - on the upper floor.TRISS: You know the inn\\'s also a whorehouse.SÍLE: Thanks for the warning.  3.3 - Kayran - A Matter of Price < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt heads to the waterfront to talk to the merchants.]MERCHANT: What do you want?GERALT: Heard you have a problem.MERCHANT: Ah, if only we had just one. Highway\\'s washed out, forest\\'s full of bandits, a river beast blocks the port and tolls are to rise!GERALT: Can\\'t help with the tolls, but the monster\\'s a possibility.MERCHANT: A sorceress said the same, but we\\'ve yet to see any results.GERALT: She\\'s asked me to work with her.MERCHANT: And who\\'s to pay your wage?GERALT: That\\'s what I\\'m here to discuss.MERCHANT: The sorceress was to manage alone. You can split that reward if you wish.Where\\'s our advance? GERALT: A contract like that requires preparations. Costly preparations.MERCHANT: You want an advance? I\\'ve but a handful of orens now, though it should buy you plenty of drink and a few hours of ploughing.GERALT: I was thinking of the potions we\\'ll need...Double the fee and I\\'m in. GERALT: Well, we\\'re managing it together now, so as I see it, you should double the reward...MERCHANT: Pghooh! You jest.I\\'ll tell Síle you\\'re looking to cheat her. GERALT: The sorceress might not know the going rates, but I\\'m a witcher. If she finds out you tried to cheat her, you\\'ll have more than the kayran to fear.MERCHANT: Enough. Your meaning\\'s clear. I shall add some gold, but the reward will not double under any circumstances.[AXII] You\\'ll double the reward. GERALT: You\\'ll double what you offered Lady de Tansarville, because that\\'s what the contract\\'s worth. [FAILURE] MERCHANT: I know what the contract\\'s worth.

We\\'ll pay exactly what we promised and not a penny more.[Continues same as \"Where\\'s our advance?\"][SUCCESS] MERCHANT: A-a-all right. We shall increase the reward.

We\\'ll add two fistfuls of orens, though our pouches will be empty.Fine. GERALT: It\\'s a deal.Gimme an advance. [Continues the same as \"Where\\'s our advance?\"]GERALT: Now, tell me what you know about the beast.MERCHANT: You\\'re the witcher, dammit. I\\'ve no knowledge of these things.GERALT: Who could tell me more?MERCHANT: That ploughing elf, Cedric, most probably. He\\'s supposed to know all about monsters.[If Cedric hasn\\'t been met yet] GERALT: Where can I find him?MERCHANT: In the village outside the walls.MERCHANT: Now leave me be.  3.4 - Kayran - Cedric and the Shipwreck < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt exits the town and runs into Triss.]TRISS: Where might you be going?GERALT: Uh, what kind of a question is that? Anyway, know where I can find an elf named Cedric?TRISS: Don\\'t get involved in this.The merchants are putting up a lot of coin... GERALT: The merchants are paying good money for killing the beast.TRISS: Coin is never the most important thing.GERALT: Maybe. But it\\'s still pretty useful.TRISS: I don\\'t trust her.GERALT: Síle? Why not?TRISS: She\\'s a powerful sorceress - dangerous to her foes. Even more dangerous to her friends.GERALT: I know you don\\'t like her. Any specific reason?TRISS: I\\'m just trying to warn you.GERALT: Thanks. I guess I\\'ll have to ask her.TRISS: How...?GERALT: We\\'re going hunting together, right after I find Cedric.Afraid of Síle? GERALT: Hmm... You did turn pale when we met Síle.TRISS: You must\\'ve imagined that.If you don\\'t want to talk, don\\'t talk. GERALT: Never mind. I\\'ll find out for myself.TRISS: How...?GERALT: We\\'re going hunting together, right after I find Cedric.I know what I saw. GERALT: I know you too well.TRISS: Síle\\'s one of the most powerful sorceresses.GERALT: That\\'s no reason to fear her.TRISS: She can\\'t be trusted - in my experience. I know her to be devious and manipulative.GERALT: Any proof?TRISS: She\\'s well aware you lost your memory, yet pretended she didn\\'t know.GERALT: Why would she do that?TRISS: I don\\'t know. Her true intentions have always been hard to fathom.GERALT: I\\'ll see if I can\\'t learn what they are.TRISS: How?GERALT: I\\'ll go hunting with her, right after I find Cedric.TRISS: Well, then let\\'s go see him. He should be at the top of his observation tower.[Geralt follows Triss and climbs up a series of wooden platforms into a tree where two elves are conversing.]SEHERIM: Imbaelk. It\\'ll be nearly a year now.CEDRIC: Moril would delight in a day like this, Seherim. Enjoy the memory of her, don\\'t wallow in the longing.SEHERIM: I try, I do. But I cannot believe all the bad blood this disappearance has bred.CEDRIC: Don\\'t let other Seidhe poison your memory of her. Hatred is but an outlet for helplessness.SEHERIM: Thank you, Cedric. Va fail.CEDRIC: Va fail.[Seherim departs, and Geralt greets Cedric.]GERALT: Are you Cedric?CEDRIC: Who asks?GERALT: Geralt of Rivia.CEDRIC: Ah, the witcher. And...?TRISS: Triss Merigold.CEDRIC: Lovely scent, Triss.GERALT: Cedric, look at me.CEDRIC: What do you want, Geralt of Rivia?I hunt monsters. GERALT: I\\'m looking to hunt in this area and I could use some advice.CEDRIC: I\\'m no witcher. I set traps, snares... try to keep nekkers away from Lobinden. That\\'s all.GERALT: I\\'m aiming a little higher than nekkers.CEDRIC: The Old Man? Meaning the kayran? Finally, Loredo\\'s splurged... Listen, I\\'m not one to teach your grandmother to suck eggs - you witchers know your work - but if you pay me, I can prepare a useful trap.GERALT: What kind of trap?CEDRIC: Puncturing trap, immobilizing trap, even decoys to pull monsters into an ambush. Whatever you like. Since I can easily finish off an ensnared nekker, it should be child\\'s play for you.Who was Moril? GERALT: The elf woman you were talking about - how did she disappear?CEDRIC: Seherim believes the forest took her.GERALT: What do you believe?CEDRIC: Moril simply vanished, almost a year ago now. Some say she was too beautiful and dh\\'oine must have harmed her.GERALT: You believe that?CEDRIC: If I have no evidence before me, I try to trust my feelings. And they tell me the forest did not take her.GERALT: Why would you keep that from Seherim?CEDRIC: Because it\\'s meaningless. Perhaps she was murdered, perhaps she departed on her own, never to return. She\\'s gone - and neither I nor Seherim can reverse that.Who are you and what do you do here? GERALT: Who exactly are you?CEDRIC: One who warns humans against the dangers that lurk in the forest.GERALT: Care to clarify?CEDRIC: I am old, even for an elf. Yet the forest is older. I\\'ve lived in it for years and understand it, though it\\'s nothing I can explain. At times I make mistakes, and people don\\'t come home.GERALT: So you help humans...CEDRIC: I just know if it\\'s safe to venture beyond the gates or not.Do I smell liquor? Are you drunk? GERALT: Maybe I\\'ll come back when you\\'re sober.CEDRIC: You witchers live a long life - you may, indeed, get to see that day.Know what the Squirrels want to achieve? GERALT: What are the Scoia\\'tael fighting for?CEDRIC: Do you ask about the old ones, who hoped to restore our race to its previous glory? Or about the young ones, who fight for survival and out of suicidal revenge?GERALT: Iorveth\\'s warriors - which mold do they fit?CEDRIC: They believe they are still independent and that there is but one just way to view their cause. In truth, however, they\\'re but a shadow of the Aen Seidhe\\'s former glory. They cling to delusions to the very moment when a sword or a noose ends their life. Or until they realize the truth themselves. Which is, I believe, the worst.[Once the kayran is dead] What\\'s the elven leader planning?GERALT: Any idea what Iorveth intends - towards Loredo or the local humans?CEDRIC: Only he knows that, but I suspect he\\'s at a loss, unsure what to do. He\\'s in the area, mounts the occasional ambush, then lies low for a few days. But he\\'s yet to put together a larger attack.GERALT: I think he\\'s waiting for the commandant to lower his guard.CEDRIC: It would appear so, but Iorveth is famous for his viciousness. He\\'s fought regular troops, attacked much larger settlements. Delaying the fight this long is unlike him. Unless there\\'s something I don\\'t know about.I\\'m hunting the kayran. Can you help? GERALT: I aim to kill the kayran. Heard you might be able to help.CEDRIC: That depends on the sort of aid you seek.GERALT: I need information.CEDRIC: We should have killed it years ago. Now... Now, I don\\'t know... The beast has become too large for the riverbed, and it has strange growths on its tentacles, extremely thick skin... Previously, it inhabited a swamp along one of the Pontar\\'s tributaries. Completely wild terrain, even the Scoia\\'tael don\\'t venture there. You should go see the wreck of the boat it recently sank. Inspect any traces it\\'s left, see the destruction.GERALT: Where\\'s this wreck?CEDRIC: Venture south into the forest, then turn east toward the river. You\\'ll find the ruins of a bridge erected long ago by the Aen Seidhe. The wreck lies at their foot.GERALT: Thanks, Cedric.TRISS: You\\'ll find me by the boat wreck.GERALT: Sheesh, Triss. Sure you\\'re not overusing those teleports?[Geralt makes his way through the forest after Triss, fighting bandits on the way. He meets her at the top of the hill.]TRISS: I wonder what\\'s left of that wreck Cedric mentioned.GERALT: If the kayran attacked the boat, it\\'s not likely to be much. We\\'re looking for traces of the beast, not boats.[They drop down a series of cliff ledges towards the wreck. Geralt notices footprints.]GERALT: See those footprints?TRISS: Yeah. Strange place for an evening walk.GERALT: Unless you\\'re looking for adventure...[They are ambushed by drowners by the water\\'s edge.]TRISS: Drowners?GERALT: Nice to run into some old friends.TRISS: Almost brings a tear to your eye...GERALT: Let\\'s examine the traces of the kayran and get out of here.[Nearby, Geralt finds a ram\\'s corpse.]GERALT: A ram stuffed with sulfur and a dead cobbler - straight out of eastern legends. Not good enough for the kayran, though.[Under the roots of a gigantic tree, they find piles of green mucus.]TRISS: Wait a minute.GERALT: What\\'re you going to do?TRISS: Cast a simple diagnostic spell. It should answer a few questions.[Triss casts her spell.]TRISS: This monster\\'s sick, Geralt... It\\'s dying.GERALT: How much time does it have left?TRISS: A few years, perhaps a decade and change...GERALT: Too long. What\\'s wrong with it? Any information could be useful.TRISS: The diagnostic spell showed that some of the cells in its body have mutated...I\\'m a mutant. GERALT: What makes you think it\\'s dying? I mean, I\\'m a mutant...TRISS: The mucus cells I diagnosed are very similar to cancer cells. In some ways, they\\'re more effective than healthy cells, but they\\'re out of control... They converge to create a red tissue - very unpleasant...GERALT: The poor thing.TRISS: But you brought up an interesting point. Want to know the core difference between mutants and non-mutants?Some other time. GERALT: Another time, maybe.[Continues the same as \"Anything else? Anything more specific?\"]Of course. GERALT: Of course I do.TRISS: The changes made through alchemy and magic in your body would require thousands of years to develop on their own. This development would result from genetic errors that would cause your body to adapt, become a more efficient organism - effectively mutate, but over a very long time. When this development occurs over millennia, across multiple generations, we proudly call it natural selection, evolution. When it occurs quickly, in a single organism or a few representatives of a species, we frown on it as mutation.GERALT: And here I thought you liked me.[Continues the same as \"Anything else? Anything more specific?\"]Anything else? Anything more specific? GERALT: What else?TRISS: The kayran\\'s highly venomous.GERALT: Any ideas for an antidote?TRISS: Your witcher\\'s metabolism should neutralize small doses of the toxin, but if I were you, I wouldn\\'t rely on my mutations alone. An ostmurk potion should do the trick.GERALT: I know the herb but haven\\'t the faintest where I might find it around here. I need to think, figure out how I want to fight the kayran. Maybe I won\\'t need the potion.TRISS: Do what you will, but don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you. Síle might be eager to get this done, but before you go see her, ask some of the locals about ostmurk. You could try Cedric. Here\\'s the formula for the potion. I need to take care of some things. Manage without me for a while?GERALT: Mhm.TRISS: See you.  3.4.01 - Kayran: Ostmurk < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to ask Cedric about the herb.]GERALT: Cedric, I need some ostmurk. It\\'s a rare variety of moss, grows underground.CEDRIC: I know it. There are some caves to the south, deep in the woods. If ostmurk grows anywhere in the area, it will be there.[Geralt finds the ostmurk in the back of a cave behind a waterfall. He brews the mongoose potion in preparation for the kayran fight.]  3.5 - AN INDECENT PROPOSAL < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Attempting to see Loredo in the daytime results in Geralt being turned away.]GERALT: Loredo wanted to see me.GUARD: Commandant\\'s busy. Come back after dusk.[As requested, Geralt goes to Loredo\\'s home after dark.]GUARD: What?GERALT: The Commandant wanted to see me.GUARD: Leave your weapon here.GERALT: Guard it with care. It\\'s very valuable.[Before Geralt can go in, Roche walks up.]ROCHE: Wait, Wolf. I need to talk to the Commandant, too.GUARD: You going inside or not?ROCHE: Listen, friend, I\\'m an officer and you\\'re a runt. And when I say jump, you will not only...GERALT: Come on, Roche.[Inside Loredo\\'s compound, soldiers are enjoying themselves around a series of campfires.]ROCHE: With these cunts, Loredo couldn\\'t protect the port from a drunk lumberjack, let alone Iorveth.GERALT: He\\'s succeeded so far, Roche.ROCHE: The port is rotting away and this prick throws fireside feasts...[A little further in, Roche catches sight of a war machine.]ROCHE: A ballista. The bastard\\'s got a ballista. You know the power of this weapon?GERALT: Mhm.ROCHE: Its arms strengthened with bronze plates and strung with horsehair, it can propel heavy bolts up to a mile away.GERALT: Yeah, an experienced crew can release two bolts each minute, but it can\\'t hit the same spot twice because it recoils and shifts. I\\'ve heard that somewhere before.ROCHE: Where did you learn about ballistae?GERALT: I knew someone who knew a bit about them.ROCHE: Unimportant. We need to damage it if we don\\'t want to be at Loredo\\'s mercy. They\\'re all drunk here now. I\\'ll provoke the guard...GERALT: Relax, Roche. I don\\'t want to fight this rabble again.ROCHE: As long as that weapon\\'s operational, no one will sail this section of the Pontar without Loredo\\'s express permission...GERALT: I\\'ll handle this. Go have a drink.  3.5.01 - The Ballista < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt notices that the guard standing by the ballista is alone, and goes to approach one of the sex workers in the compound.]MARGARITA: What do you need, ugly?Ugly...? GERALT: Ugly?MARGARITA: Well, you ain\\'t exactly handsome.GERALT: But...MARGARITA: I wouldn\\'t worry. Women prefer ugly men to groomed dandies. And you\\'re ugly something mighty. Care for a romp?GERALT: Can\\'t just now, but I\\'ll find you later in town. What\\'s your name?MARGARITA: Margarita.I wanted to surprise my friend. GERALT: I wanted to surprise my friend... The sad-looking guy by the ballista.MARGARITA: Some idiot wanted me to read him poems recently... Extravagance, as I see it. I didn\\'t like it.GERALT: I was thinking of something a little more traditional.MARGARITA: What would you have me do?Your specialty. GERALT: Just go with your specialty.MARGARITA: All right. It\\'ll be my standard rate.GERALT: Draw him away from the ballista, while you\\'re at it.MARGARITA: Slap me hard and call me stupid! Tryin\\' to put one by me? That\\'ll cost you more.GERALT: How\\'s that?MARGARITA: Surcharge on special requests. Those are the rules...GERALT: Lemme think it over.[Same options to continue as \"You choose.\"]You choose. GERALT: I don\\'t really care. Just get him away from the ballista.MARGARITA: Oh, now you got me doubting he\\'s your mate at all. But I\\'ll not pry. It\\'ll cost you double.GERALT: That\\'s steep.MARGARITA: I may be a simple girl, but I know at least a few men who\\'d give you trouble if I told them what you\\'ve asked of me... Pay me and it’ll stay between us. I mean no point in giving brutes and louts a good reason to perfect their skills, eh?Any other way I could convince you? GERALT: A favor for a favor?[If you haven\\'t arm-wrestled Loredo\\'s guards] MARGARITA: There is one thing you could do for me.GERALT: And that is?MARGARITA: Myron and Alphonse, two of Loredo\\'s thugs. Give them a good thrashing and I\\'ll even blow...GERALT: I stirred up enough trouble as it is during the execution.MARGARITA: No need to stir trouble. Just humiliate them someways.GERALT: Consider it done.[If you have beaten Loredo\\'s guards] MARGARITA: You\\'ve helped me already. Humiliating Myron and Alphonse - that was something. Thank you.GERALT: The pleasure was all mine.[BRIBE] I\\'m willing to pay... [Not enough coins]\\xa0MARGARITA: I\\'ll not show you so much as a tit for that.[After paying or beating the guards]MARGARITA: All right, I\\'m off to give the boy some diversion.[Geralt challenges Myron.]MYRON: I don\\'t like freaks.GERALT: And I don\\'t like oafish no-necks.MYRON: What do you want, mutant?GERALT: To try my luck, arm wrestling.MYRON: I\\'m gonna crush you, mutant.GERALT: Save the boasting till later. Let\\'s do this.[FAILURE] MYRON: You\\'re weak! A lame mutant, downright pitiful.[SUCCESS] MYRON: I hate mutants like you!GERALT: I know, I know.[Geralt challenges Alphonse.]ALPHONSE: What you want, old man?GERALT: I was looking to test my strength - arm wrestling.ALPHONSE: What do I stand to gain?GERALT: Nothing, \\'cause I\\'ll thrash you.ALPHONSE: And if I win?GERALT: You\\'ll have beat a witcher, so I guess that gets you bragging rights.ALPHONSE: Are you that Geralt fellow? The Gray Wolf?GERALT: Mhm.ALPHONSE: All right. Let\\'s begin. [FAILURE] ALPHONSE: Heh, you\\'re a lightweight, Gray Wolf.[SUCCESS] ALPHONSE: Damn the dogs! The old man got me... I need to eat, build up a bit.[Margarita lures the guard away.]MARGARITA: Care for a little diversion, grave one?GUARD: I\\'m on duty...MARGARITA: Oh, come on. Your comrades are well at it, havin\\' their fun. Why should you be any worse?GUARD: You\\'re right. Let\\'s go.MARGARITA: How was it?GUARD: With tits like that you could conquer all Temeria, darlin\\'![After the guard is away from the ballista, Geralt takes a piece of the mechanism out and goes to rejoin Roche.]GERALT: Ballista\\'s decommissioned.ROCHE: Perfect. Let\\'s go see Loredo.[Geralt and Roche go up the steps to Loredo\\'s house, but are turned away.]GUARD: Loredo\\'s busy with that witch, Síle. Come back later.ROCHE: Geralt, let\\'s wait downstairs in the yard...ROCHE: Yes?[If Geralt has not sabotaged the ballista yet] Got any idea how to get rid of the guard by the ballista? GERALT: How did you plan to get rid of the guard by the ballista?ROCHE: I have my ways. But you wanted to do it alone, so go talk to the buffoon.GERALT: Do we wait until the honorable lady is done with the venerable hick?ROCHE: Waste of time, Looks like a good number of Flotsam\\'s town watchmen are here... We should look around... Did you see that arbalist behind the house?ROCHE: I\\'ll get his attention, give him something to think about. Why don\\'t you find out what they\\'re guarding so closely.[If the kayran hasn\\'t been killed yet] MAN: My apologies, gentlemen, I could not help overhearing your conversation...ROCHE: What do you want?MAN: In point of fact, it\\'s a matter for the witcher. I have an offer... Let me hear it. GERALT: An offer... Interesting.MAN: I suspect you did not come to Flotsam for pleasure alone...GERALT: You suspect right.MAN: Do you know about the monster in the river?Maybe. GERALT: Might\\'ve heard something.MAN: I expect someone will hire you to deal with it sooner or later. Thus, I presume that...GERALT: Stop presuming, expecting and concluding. Just tell me what you want.MAN: Our honored host is in possession of part of a trap, built especially for the beast in question.GERALT: Go on...MAN: Around back there\\'s a storage area where Loredo keeps the treasures he confiscates from merchants and travelers. There are heaps of things out there...GERALT: Let me guess, you know exactly where I need to look.MAN: Precisely. I saw Loredo\\'s men carrying the contraption across the garden in a crate. They placed it on a platform by the wall beyond which lies the craftsmen\\'s district.GERALT: Why are you telling me?MAN: Why, we need to be rid of the beast as soon as possible! Good luck!Not a thing. GERALT: What monster?[Continues the same way as \"Maybe\".]Not now. [EXIT]ROCHE: All right, I\\'ll distract the guard. You sneak behind the house.GERALT: Brilliant as ever.[Roche calls out to the guard around the side of the house.]ROCHE: Soldier! Report to me immediately!SOLDIER: What do you want?ROCHE: Shut it, soldier. Have respect for your superiors or spend the rest of your life on the king\\'s galley.SOLDIER: Apologies, sir, I didn\\'t realize...ROCHE: As I see it, the entire garrison could use a lesson in discipline. Isn\\'t that right?SOLDIER: Sir!ROCHE: That\\'s the attitude, soldier. The Commandant will hear of this.[Geralt sneaks around. Through the windows next to the first guard, Loredo\\'s mother can be seen mumbling to herself and puttering around what appears to be a fisstech lab.]MARIETTA: The coca leaf will rid you of grief...MARIETTA: Dispel the dark spider\\'s web of dreams...MARIETTA: La-da-dah, la-dah, da-da-da-doo...MARIETTA: Marietta, pretty little Mary, has found a treasure trove..MARIETTA: Leaves upon leaves, a coca plant grove... La-da-dum, da-dum, da-da-da-dum, -da-dum...[Geralt manages to peek through one of the windows and overhear Loredo and Síle\\'s conversation.]SÍLE: You forget who you\\'re dealing with, Commandant.LOREDO: You must think me an idiot.SÍLE: I cannot help myself. You take guardsman off the streets to guard carpets, fabrics and spices pilfered from merchants. Do you have any grasp of the responsibility that rests with you?LOREDO: Don\\'t teach an old man to piss, sorceress. I\\'ve ruled Flotsam for years.SÍLE: Flotsam is ruled by a fear of Iorveth. That fear rules even you.LOREDO: I\\'ve made my demands perfectly clear.SÍLE: Like a crying babe deprived of its rattle. In time, Commandant, they\\'ll hang you by the neck from a roadside tree like a regular bandit. And rightly so, for you\\'re no better.LOREDO: Your time will come too, sorceress. They\\'ll pile kindling at your feet.SÍLE: Enough! Fear has confused you. Think over what I said and give your answer before it\\'s too late.[Geralt retrieves the part for the kayran trap and heads back to Roche.]ROCHE: Didn\\'t like him from the start.GERALT: Loredo\\'s storing valuable \\'gifts\\' from the merchants right here. He may be expecting Iorveth to attack.That\\'s not all... GERALT: I overheard the Commandant talking to Síle. I couldn\\'t pinpoint the topic of their conversation, but it seems to me he\\'s angling for something.Let\\'s go. GERALT: Let\\'s pay the Commandant a visit.ROCHE: We\\'ll see what he has to say.[Geralt and Roche go up the steps.]GUARD: Go in - they await you.ROCHE: Where are we to go? I\\'d hardly call this a hut.GUARD: You, I mean, you sir, cannot enter. We\\'ve been ordered to let in the witcher but no one else.ROCHE: Son of a bitch! Fine - he wants to play hard, we\\'ll play hard.GUARD: I don\\'t want any trouble. I\\'ll call for support!ROCHE: No need. Tell Loredo I got the message.GERALT: See you, Roche.[Geralt runs into Síle in the hall.]SÍLE: Here to see the Commandant?GERALT: We have business to discuss.SÍLE: Good luck... He\\'s in a foul mood.GERALT: Why?SÍLE: We\\'ll talk another time, and definitely elsewhere.[If Geralt is caught sneaking] GUARD: In Flotsam, we cut the hands off thieves...GERALT: I was looking for the privy.GUARD: You\\'re lucky the Commandant wants to see you. Come on.[The guard brings Geralt in to see Loredo.]GUARD: Commandant, sir, we caught the witcher sneaking around the garden.LOREDO: Bring him in and leave!GUARD: Yes, sir!SÍLE: We were just discussing a certain matter. You here on business, too?GERALT: The Commandant wanted to see me.SÍLE: In that case, I shall leave you to it.LOREDO: Finally!GERALT: They didn’t want to let me in... while the sorceress was here.LOREDO: Did you see her? Made up like a whore on parade day. They think they can do anything, those sorceresses.LOREDO: I heard what happened in Temeria. You know your name\\'s on a warrant? It\\'s unfortunate... though nothing that should impede our dealings. See, I\\'m the law around here, and the law needs to know what the legendary White Wolf\\'s doing in this cesspit.Nothing specific. GERALT: I\\'m a witcher. I hunt monsters for coin.[Continues same as \"LOREDO: I suppose we all have our secrets.\"]That\\'s my business. GERALT: That\\'s no concern of yours.LOREDO: Listen, witcher - here in Flotsam, everything\\'s my ploughing concern. Let me help you, Geralt.I don\\'t need your help. GERALT: I do all right on my own.LOREDO: I suppose we all have our secrets. I just hope you resist questioning my authority in public again.What do you want from me? GERALT: Let\\'s talk business, Commandant.[Continues same as from \"LOREDO: I trust you\\'re on our side?\"]Why don\\'t you trust Roche? GERALT: What about Vernon Roche? Why didn\\'t you let him in?LOREDO: Roche? Know the aura that surrounds him? Men like him act first and think later. And when they act, almost inevitably innocent blood flows.[Continues same as from \"LOREDO: I trust you\\'re on our side?\"]I\\'m looking for the kingslayer. GERALT: I\\'m looking for the man responsible for Foltest\\'s death.LOREDO: Here?GERALT: I know the Scoia\\'tael had a hand in it, too. It\\'s their trail I followed to Flotsam.LOREDO: Lucky you found Bernard Loredo, then. If you\\'re telling the truth, Iorveth\\'s got royal blood on his hands. I can help you find him.Why don\\'t you trust Roche? [Same as above.]Iorveth\\'s not my target. GERALT: The kingslayer - that\\'s who I want. Huge man, pretty hard to mistake.LOREDO: Was it him...?GERALT: Yeah, he killed Foltest. Now he\\'s sneaking around these woods.LOREDO: In that case, we\\'ll get him, too.[If the kayran is dead] LOREDO: I heard you killed the kayran. Flotsam is grateful.LOREDO: Let\\'s say that squares the crimes of your friends. They\\'re free to go.LOREDO: I trust you\\'re on our side?GERALT: Whose side is that?LOREDO: That of the people of Flotsam, of course. Terrorized by the elven bandits for years now.Bandits deserve no mercy. GERALT: My enemy\\'s enemy is my friend. We barely escaped with our lives the last time we ran into Iorveth.LOREDO: Damned Squirrels draw ever nearer.What about the nonhumans in Flotsam? GERALT: What about the elves and dwarves in the trading post - the smiths, peddlers and hunters? They eat with you, sleep among you. Whose side are they on?LOREDO: Hell if I know. That\\'s my point, witcher - when you fight for survival, you need to be sure who your friends are.LOREDO: The nonhumans in Flotsam... Sure, they eat, fuck, shit among us, but when Iorveth sounds the battle horns, who knows what they\\'ll do.They chose Flotsam. GERALT: They haven\\'t proved their loyalty already, placing walls between Iorveth and themselves?LOREDO: They understand that bandit, witcher. They share his language, his methods, his beliefs. We let them live among us, but we watch them. One night, they just might cut our throats and open the gates.GERALT: Talk like that makes me sick.Treat them better, and they\\'ll show you loyalty. GERALT: I\\'m surprised they haven\\'t turned on you already.LOREDO: How so?GERALT: The town guards treat nonhumans like shit. Frankly, I don\\'t know what keeps them here.LOREDO: I\\'ll tell you what, Geralt - the hunger they\\'d face in the forest. But I grant you, those acts of, uh, insubordination need to be stopped. Soldiers are simple men. When you see your mate die, a Scoia\\'tael arrow in his throat, it\\'s hard to look favorably at the elf who sells your wife colored kerchiefs.They could stand with Iorveth. GERALT: Iorveth talks about driving off the dh\\'oine, he calls the elder races superior. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if some of the poorer nonhumans secretly support him.LOREDO: Right you are. As long as Iorveth remains weak, they\\'re afraid to join him. But what happens if he gains strength? Woe to Flotsam, I say.[All continue with \"LOREDO: You\\'re a witcher.\" below.]What\\'s your point, Loredo? GERALT: Your point, Commandant?[Continues with \"LOREDO: You\\'re a witcher.\" below.]I don\\'t want to get involved in that. GERALT: A local conflict. None of my business.LOREDO: You killed some elves on the riverbank outside Flotsam.GERALT: We were attacked.[Continues with \"LOREDO: You fail to understand...\"]Geralt choice: You have only yourselves to blame. GERALT: There was a time those forests belonged to the elves. To them, humans are bandits.LOREDO: Spare me your sympathy! The elder races, the elder language - plough it all! Today, they torch human settlements, they poison our wells and they murder us along the highways.[Continues with \"LOREDO: You fail to understand...\"]LOREDO: You fail to understand...GERALT: It\\'s you who doesn\\'t understand, Loredo. To tell you the truth, I\\'m not human.LOREDO: You an elf? A dwarf? No. Y\\'talking bollocks... I piss on the fact that they call you \\'freak\\' for your white hair and glowing eyes. You\\'re a human like any other.LOREDO: We\\'re fighting a war. And you, my friend, cannot straddle the fence.And the nonhumans in Flotsam? [Same as \"What about the nonhumans in Flotsam?\"]LOREDO: You\\'re a witcher. Your job is to protect the simpletons from monsters. I protect them from the danger that lurks amongst the trees.Untrue, you\\'re just a racist. GERALT: You detest nonhumans.LOREDO: I detest Iorveth, the coward who hunts the innocent instead of facing soldiers. I detest that whoreson who murders women and children while claiming that he fights for freedom! He\\'s a monster, Geralt. He\\'s the evil I protect people from. And anyone who helps a monster becomes a similar monster to my mind.GERALT: Enough. I get it.You mean Iorveth. GERALT: I see where this is going.LOREDO: Iorveth\\'s no better than a monster that attacks those who go out to gather kindling. Matter of fact, he\\'s worse - he\\'s smarter and crueler.GERALT: How do we get him?LOREDO: I don\\'t want you to kill him. Even you don\\'t have a hope against his entire force.LOREDO: I\\'ve an idea, but I\\'d rather not go into it now. The Squirrels are up to something. Every night their scouts come closer. I suspect they plan to attack the barge moored in the port.A barge? GERALT: What\\'s on the barge?LOREDO: You mean who. Bandits, murderers, rapists - on their way to the dungeons at Drakenborg, as soon as...GERALT: Their infamous leader joins them. The cherry on the cake, and Bernard Loredo\\'s crown trophy.LOREDO: Couldn’t have put it better myself.What should I do? GERALT: What do you want me to do?LOREDO: As long as Iorveth remains free, humans, elves and dwarves will live alongside each other in deep distrust. I\\'ve got to learn what the pointy-eared rat is planning.GERALT: How am I supposed to get that information?LOREDO: Ha! You underestimate me, witcher. True, I have my prejudices, but I\\'m not blinded by them.LOREDO: Take your friend, Zoltan, for instance - he contacted Iorveth.[If the kayran isn\\'t dead] GERALT: How can Zoltan help if he can\\'t go outside the walls?LOREDO: Hah! Step by step, Geralt, that\\'s how you build trust.LOREDO: You could start by tending to a problem we have. A beast, the kayran, has blocked all boat traffic. I\\'m losing tolls, that is, uh, the trading post is losing revenue. Kill the kayran and I\\'ll declare your friends acquitted of their crimes. Then Zoltan can take you to see Iorveth.There must be a reward on Iorveth\\'s head. What\\'s it up to these days? GERALT: I\\'m a witcher. I don\\'t work for free.LOREDO: Course you don\\'t. Help us capture the Scoia\\'tael commander and you\\'ll be rewarded generously, straight from the trading post\\'s treasury.It\\'s a deal. [Same as below.]Sorry, no deal. [Same as below.]It\\'s a deal. GERALT: I\\'ll see what I can find out.LOREDO: Though you stir up storms wherever you go, I actually believe you\\'ll bring peace to Flotsam. Don\\'t disappoint this town, Geralt.I\\'ll see what I can do. GERALT: I\\'ll talk to Zoltan.LOREDO: I trust you\\'ll make the right decision.Sorry, no deal. GERALT: I came and heard you out. Now I\\'ve heard enough.LOREDO: You\\'re refusing to help?GERALT: You\\'re vile, Loredo. I hope you and Iorveth face each other someday, and may the best rat win.LOREDO: You\\'ll regret those words, witcher! I promise you that. Now get outta my sight!LOREDO: Farewell. [If Geralt rejected him outright, he says nothing.][Geralt leaves Loredo\\'s house. If the kayran is still alive, Geralt can find the man who gave him the tip about the trap.][If Geralt was caught by guards]MAN: What happened?GERALT: You neglected to mention the regiment of guards... They caught me.MAN: Lucky we\\'re all in mourning... I mean, otherwise they would\\'ve hung you on the spot.[If Geralt got the trap part]MAN: Success?GERALT: I still need a few things, but you helped me a lot.MAN: You\\'ll find me at the market. Best of luck, witcher.[Geralt goes to find Roche.]ROCHE: Turned me away at the door, the bastard!GERALT: All set.ROCHE: We\\'ll meet later. Don\\'t forget your weapons on the way out.[The two of them leave the compound.]  3.6 - KILLING THE KAYRAN < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[After making his preparations, Geralt goes to see Síle in her room above the tavern.]SÍLE: Witcher, I\\'ve been awaiting you.GERALT: We need to kill a monster that sinks boats.SÍLE: Afraid?GERALT: No, but I suspect we\\'ll need to draw it onto the shore.SÍLE: Leave that to me.GERALT: I can\\'t wait... I bet it\\'s something spectacular.SÍLE: Believe it. You\\'ll do the honors.GERALT: The honors?SÍLE: Once on the riverbank, you\\'ll kill him... her... whatever it is. The kayran - any idea where it came from?GERALT: Did you find out where the kayran came from?SÍLE: I didn\\'t even try.GERALT: So I take it you know it was created by a mage.SÍLE: I guessed as much. And what of it? Do you wish me to feel guilty, apologize for some madman? I don\\'t intend to. How did you know it was a mage?GERALT: I didn\\'t. Just guessed.There\\'s magic in that beast. GERALT: Triss claims the kayran was born of magic.SÍLE: She\\'s right. Something that large couldn\\'t possibly evolve in the waters of the Pontar. It looks like the result of some botched experiment... It\\'s growing rapidly and will probably age just as quickly.Can we talk about something besides business? GERALT: If we\\'re going to work together, we should get to know each other.SÍLE: Is that so? Very well... Ask what you will.You and Triss know each other well? GERALT: Are you and Triss friends?SÍLE: Friends...? Colleagues, I\\'d say. Acquaintances, perhaps. I know all the sorceresses in the North. We aren\\'t that many in number. Which is why we support one another.You usually hunt monsters? GERALT: Do you always take on witchers\\' work?SÍLE: Occasionally. If it pays exceptionally well. You don\\'t like the competition?I don\\'t like amateurs. GERALT: We should each do whatever we\\'re best at.SÍLE: Well... We\\'ll have to see. I certainly hope I don\\'t embarrass myself.Don\\'t care either way. GERALT: It\\'s no bother, as long as demand outweighs supply.SÍLE: Right.No, it\\'s fine. I mean, I like you. GERALT: I like your kind of competition.SÍLE: Let\\'s hope it works out for us both. I haven\\'t traveled this far to have the kayran slip through my fingers now.Let\\'s get to work. GERALT: No time to lose.SÍLE: Exactly.Count on me to prevent that from happening. GERALT: I won\\'t let you down.Do you travel alone? GERALT: Traveling alone - that can\\'t be pleasant.SÍLE: I\\'ve never needed protection. I have ways of dealing with unpleasant surprises.GERALT: What about pleasant surprises?SÍLE: Is that how you think of yourself, witcher?Are you suggesting I am? GERALT: You seem to see me that way.SÍLE: We\\'d best get to work.No one sees me that way. GERALT: People usually avoid witchers.SÍLE: Then I hope I don\\'t regret my decision not to.[PERSUASION] You gotta learn for yourself. GERALT: There\\'s only one way to find out.[FAILURE] SÍLE: Kill the kayran and you will have been.[SUCCESS] SÍLE: Kill the kayran, witcher. That\\'s what\\'s important now.[If you talked to Zoltan at the tavern] What did you hire Zoltan to do? GERALT: Zoltan told me you hired him to make something.SÍLE: Your dwarven friend has a way with stones. He helped repair my megascope. The set of the diamond must be very precise if it\\'s to focus the light appropriately.That\\'s quite a contraption. What is it? GERALT: What\\'s that? It looks impressive.SÍLE: A megascope.GERALT: What does it do?SÍLE: Many complicated, magical operations. It allows me to communicate with other sorceresses, for instance.[If Geralt completed An Indecent Proposal] Got something going with the Commandant? GERALT: I never expected to see you at Loredo\\'s.SÍLE: Whereas I was sure you would show up there. The Commandant is terribly jealous about his small trading post. Anyone of import is summoned to hear him out sooner rather than later.GERALT: What did he want from you?SÍLE: That is my concern, certainly none of yours. We\\'re not a tandem, Geralt. We\\'ll kill the kayran together, but that is all.See you. [EXIT] GERALT: I\\'ll be ready soon.SÍLE: I certainly hope so.I\\'m ready. GERALT: I\\'ve got everything I need. Let\\'s go.SÍLE: Excellent![Scene cuts; Geralt and Síle are outside together in the forest.]SÍLE: Ready?GERALT: Are you wearing makeup?SÍLE: We all have our rituals.GERALT: From what I know kayrans are colorblind.SÍLE: Enough, Geralt. Time to draw the beast out of the water.GERALT: Got an ace up your sleeve?SÍLE: I always do. Don\\'t get eaten and we\\'ll soon both be heroes.GERALT: I hope you\\'re right.[Síle goes to take her position on top of the bridge above the kayran\\'s lair.]SÍLE: You descend into the lair. I\\'ll stay on the bridge and pull it out onto the bank. Take care, it\\'ll be extremely dangerous, even on land.[Geralt makes his way down to the lair. From her position, Síle casts a spell. The kayran erupts from the water and attacks. Geralt meets it in battle. As he does so, Síle shouts advice from above.]SÍLE: Use a Sign! Trap it with the Yrden!SÍLE: Yrden! Trap it with the Yrden!GERALT: You come down and trap it!SÍLE: It\\'s angry! Watch out!SÍLE: Quickly! It\\'s about to break free!![Geralt severs the kayran\\'s tentacles. As it thrashes, it damages the bridge, which collapses and traps the beast. Geralt runs up to its carapace and uses a bomb to kill the kayran.]SÍLE: We did it! Not a bad fight, wouldn\\'t you say, Geralt? Are you all right?That was tough. GERALT: The beast got me a couple of times.SÍLE: I\\'ve heard you\\'ve been in more dire situations. I wonder, are the stories about you true?All of them without exception. GERALT: They couldn\\'t be more true. Especially the ones that are made up.They\\'re all lies. GERALT: People are always talking shit.SÍLE: That\\'s how legends are born.Which ones? GERALT: What stories?SÍLE: If you think I\\'m going to repeat some of the legends circulating about you, you\\'re deeply mistaken.GERALT: What now?SÍLE: I must harvest the most valuable ingredients while the corpse is fresh. I\\'d prefer to get the entire carcass to my laboratory and strip it down to the bone. But that would be a waste of Power and simply too much work. I shall take only...GERALT: What have you heard about me?SÍLE: A number of things.GERALT: You won\\'t talk about them?SÍLE: I\\'ve no time, now. The fresher the ingredients I collect, the higher price I\\'ll get. Sorry.I\\'m fine. GERALT: I\\'m fine.SÍLE: I\\'ve used up much of my energy, so if you needed help...GERALT: I\\'ve learned to help myself. Hm... a sorceress worried about me... Should I be scared?SÍLE: Playing it tough, like every witcher.I\\'m not playing anything. GERALT: New bruises and scars come with every fight. Toughness comes from experience.SÍLE: You talk like an old man. Yes, your hair is gray, but I believe the blood courses quickly through your veins.GERALT: Have you made plans that include me?SÍLE: For now, my plans only involve the kayran.What about the kayran? GERALT: I had no idea it\\'d be so big.SÍLE: Triss was right, it\\'s mutated... magically induced. I must get to work, collect the most valuable ingredients. What a shame so much will go to waste. Forgive me, time is of the essence.GERALT: Farewell, then.SÍLE: Don\\'t forget to collect the reward.GERALT: Oh, I won\\'t.[Geralt collects his reward from the merchant.]GERALT: Job done. The kayran\\'s dead.MERCHANT: Good work. You\\'ve earned your reward.[Geralt can, optionally, check back in with Loredo.]LOREDO: Any news for me, witcher?I killed the kayran. GERALT: I killed the kayran. Síle and I dragged it out of the water, toppled a piece of the bridge to weigh it down, and blew it up.LOREDO: I em... I heard...GERALT: So, Dandelion and Zoltan are free?LOREDO: As we agreed.Some garrison you have here. GERALT: You\\'ve got a heap of soldiers for such a small trading post.LOREDO: Bandits swarm to trading routes like flies to shit. Only troops can guarantee some order here. We\\'re the last Temerian outpost in this area and we\\'ll not give in to a bunch of elves.How long has Iorveth been bothering you? GERALT: I guess you\\'re finding it hard to get rid of Iorveth.LOREDO: He\\'s stubborn, it\\'s true... but he\\'s met his match. And I\\'m not about to leave Flotsam to the same fate as the other towns and villages the Scoia\\'tael have burned to the ground.LOREDO: The citizens of Flotsam owe the elves nothing. They built their homes and workshops with their own hands in the wilderness, not on the ruins of an elven town. If need be, we\\'ll remind the long-ears where they belong.See you. [EXIT] LOREDO: Get out of my sight!  3.7 - Visiting Ciaran < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[After Geralt collects his rewards for killing the kayran, Triss is waiting for him.]TRISS: Well, well... How\\'s the Commandant as a host?GERALT: It\\'s people like him who might help us.TRISS: Or put us in shackles and throw us into the river.GERALT: He told me they\\'re keeping Scoia\\'tael prisoners on a barge in the port.TRISS: Did he mention if Ciaran aep Easnillen, Iorveth\\'s right hand elf, is among them?GERALT: No...TRISS: He may know something about the kingslayer.GERALT: Let\\'s pay him a visit.[Geralt follows Triss to Loredo\\'s prison barge.]GUARD: What do you want?GERALT: To speak with the wounded prisoner.[If you refused Loredo] GUARD: Very funny. Go on... away with you!TRISS: Commandant Loredo sent me to heal him.GUARD: Who are you?TRISS: A healer.GUARD: Healing elves? That don\\'t sound like the Commandant.He\\'s Iorveth\\'s deputy and worth more alive... GERALT: He\\'s Iorveth\\'s second-in-command.GUARD: Even better if he kicks the bucket.GERALT: He\\'s no use to us dead. He could know a lot. Loredo doesn\\'t want him taking his secrets to the grave.TRISS: That\\'s why he sent me.GERALT: All right. Just don\\'t try anything stupid.[INTIMIDATION] Loredo himself issued the order. GERALT: Are you questioning orders?[FAILURE] GUARD: I only take orders from the Commandant, mongrel.[SUCCESS] GUARD: No... \\'course not. You\\'ll find him below deck.How does a pouch full of orens sound? GERALT: Would a pouch full of orens make it sound like the Commandant?GUARD: For that much you can even bugger him. Just make it quick.[If you agreed to help Loredo] GUARD: No one\\'s allowed.GERALT: I\\'m here on Commandant Loredo\\'s orders.GUARD: I heard he cut a deal with you, but...GERALT: So get out of my way.GUARD: He won\\'t tell you much. He\\'s dying.[Geralt and Triss board the barge and go down below to the cells.]GUARD 1: Shut your traps! Stop bloody moaning down there!GUARD 2: Look, Cougher\\'s dozed off.GUARD 1: Wakey, wakey, Cougher. You\\'ll fall asleep forever any day now.GUARD 2: Heh, heh, heh.GUARD 1: Look, Birdie\\'s all wet. Hey, Birdie, you get wet just looking at me?GUARD 2: Get ready, Birdie, we\\'ll be down to see you right after our watch.[Ciaran is laying prone in the back of the boat. Triss kneels to examine him.]TRISS: They beat him bad... He\\'s got at least a dozen fractures. I\\'ll need your help.GERALT: What do I do?TRISS: The spell I\\'m going to use is painful. It could kill him if he thrashes around.GERALT: I\\'ll use the Axii Sign to calm him.TRISS: Perfect.[If you fail to cast Axii properly] CIARAN: AAAaarghhh...!!!TRISS: Focus, or you\\'ll kill him!GERALT: Killing is a witcher\\'s trade.TRISS: Let\\'s try again.[Triss casts her spell.]GERALT: It\\'s no use.CIARAN: You wish, whoreson.

GERALT: We\\'re fighting Loredo, too - a common goal.CIARAN: I once made the mistake of trusting dh\\'oine. Never again.We saved your life.

GERALT: There\\'s a witcher in Iorveth\\'s unit.CIARAN: Like every dh\\'oine... he turned out to be a bastard.GERALT: What happened?CIARAN: He betrayed us... He said he had an offer for me. So we met - where roses of remembrance grow. I should have known...TRISS: Roses of remembrance?CIARAN: Yes, some of the last in the world. He thought that I\\'d betray my elven brother in order to control the unit. I refused, and there was a fight.CIARAN: I\\'ve never seen anything like it... No human can move that fast. It was a massacre. I was the first to be hit, thus I survived. I would have bled to death had Loredo\\'s men not found me... Letho will kill Iorveth and all will be lost. So many dead, so much suffering, all for naught.This Letho is Foltest\\'s killer? GERALT: Letho - he\\'s the kingslayer?CIARAN: Yes.Why does Letho want Iorveth dead? GERALT: Why does the dh\\'oine want Iorveth dead?CIARAN: He used us. From the start. Our hatred... But he no longer needs Iorveth, sees him as a thorn in his side, though I don\\'t know what Letho wants.What\\'s Iorveth planning? GERALT: What does Iorveth want? Why Flotsam?CIARAN: Go plough yourself.[PERSUASION] Only I can warn Iorveth. GERALT: Only I can warn Iorveth.

In due time, Iorveth will answer the call, and we\\'ll emerge from the woods, joining the battle.GERALT: What battle?CIARAN: He wasn\\'t specific.Your choice... GERALT: In that case, I\\'ll ask Iorveth himself.CIARAN: Ugh. I\\'d like to see that.We\\'ve heard enough. Farewell. GERALT: We got what we came for.TRISS: What now?GERALT: Iorveth.TRISS: What if Iorveth already knows?GERALT: I\\'ve got an old saying all ready for him: my enemy\\'s enemy is my friend.CIARAN: Warn him, Gwynbleidd. Iorveth fights, for that is what he does best. He\\'s Aen Seidhe - a real one, a free one. Among the last... Fighting makes sense - now more than ever before. There is still hope.GERALT: What\\'re you talking about, Ciaran? Hope for what?CIARAN: For change, for a better tomorrow... I\\'ll not see it - they\\'ll torment me to death on this barge and I\\'ll go gladly where the apple trees bloom. But you must warn Iorveth.[Geralt experiences a flashback of himself and Yennefer on the island Ciri brought them to - and what happened when the Wild Hunt found them. GERALT, NARRATING: Yennefer told me that Ciri has departed for good. She inhabits another world and is happy there. Before she left this one, she gave us the Isle of Avallach. Our island... We stopped counting time.\\xa0People believe that the wraiths of the Wild Hunt are immortal. They race across the heavens gripping in their bony hands swords that are lightning bolts. They take away mortals, ever expanding their cavalcade of spectral riders. They burned the orchard and the house. In their armored boots, they trampled our island. And they made off with Yennefer.\\xa0I had to get her back, return to reality, return to the witcher’s Path.]TRISS: Geralt... Are you all right?GERALT: I\\'ve been to the Isle of Avallach, among the apple trees and the mists. After the massacre in Rivia, Ciri took me there, and Yennefer. The wraith riders kidnapped Yen, and I pursued them.TRISS: But...GERALT: Triss, this is important. I feel like everything\\'s coming together. When the witchers found me barely alive a half year ago near Kaer Morhen, I was fleeing the wraiths of the Hunt. They continued to pursue me - in the Outskirts, then in Vizima when I killed the Grand Master... Now I know it was no coincidence.TRISS: Ciaran mentioned roses of remembrance, growing somewhere near here. Cedric claims likewise. If that\\'s true...GERALT: Right now I should be searching the forest for Iorveth, not looking for flowers.TRISS: ...I could restore your memory.GERALT: You sure?TRISS: Everything seems to indicate that. Whatever\\'s blocking your memory is clearly weakening. I think I could break that barrier with just one petal from a rose of remembrance. Those flowers are truly powerful.GERALT: In that case, Iorveth can wait.TRISS: Want me to go with you?I need to do this on my own. GERALT: I\\'ll take care of this on my own. Wait for me in town.TRISS: I want to help...GERALT: I\\'ll manage.TRISS: Uh-huh...GERALT: This won\\'t take long. I\\'ll ask some locals about the elven ruins, find the rose, and I\\'ll be back.TRISS: I\\'ll be waiting.It\\'d be nice if you did. GERALT: I\\'d love your company.TRISS: All right, then. Let\\'s go. Cedric mentioned there are some old elven buildings near the cascade in the forest. We should start there.GERALT: Lead the way.  3.8 - The Rose of Remembrance < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[If Geralt chose not to have Triss go with him, he can ask around Flotsam for tips on where to go, starting with the herbalist Anezka.]GERALT: I\\'m looking for a rose of remembrance. Know where I can find or buy one?ANEZKA: Not your lucky day, wanderer. Sold my last one, oh, three winters ago, must be. But earnestly, I received one a few years back from a huntsman who sought to make me his woman. He found it deep in the forest, where practically no one dares venture.GERALT: Even you?ANEZKA: Fate needs no tempting. The huntsman\\'s long since dead, and he was a large, strong man who knew the forest well. I\\'m in no hurry to see the beyond.GERALT: Any idea who could tell me more?ANEZKA: Well, no one knows the wood better than Cedric.[Geralt goes to Cedric.]GERALT: I need a rose of remembrance. Can you help?CEDRIC: You speak of Eldan and Cymoril\\'s bloom...Yes, Gwynbleidd, I know where they grow.GERALT: Where might that be?CEDRIC: In the garden of the eternal lovers...GERALT: Where\\'s that?CEDRIC: It\\'s no place for humans. Loredo pays some rats to bring him sculptures from the garden...GERALT: I\\'m not working for Loredo.CEDRIC: Got a drink? Vodka\\'d be best.GERALT: Argh... Cedric.CEDRIC: I must have a drink. The specters approach to torment me with their visions. I can feel it. Do you have any vodka?No. GERALT: I\\'m fresh out.CEDRIC: I must acquire some drink.... Please help me, Gwynbleidd.GERALT: You\\'ve lost your mind to drink if you think I\\'ll go looking for liquor right now...CEDRIC: I think nothing of the sort. But I need a loan, some gold. I\\'ll pay you back...[BRIBE] Here. [Not enough coin] CEDRIC: That\\'s nowhere near enough, Gwynbleidd. I\\'ve debts to settle... And I really cannot manage sober.[SUCCESS] CEDRIC: Thanks, witcher. I shall repay you... Made a map once. Should be useful to you. Marked some interesting sites on it, Eldan and Cymoril\\'s garden among them...GERALT: Thanks.Take this. GERALT: Here.CEDRIC: Ah, thank you. The forest has been calmer since you killed the kayran, you know.GERALT: Glad to hear it. Now focus, Cedric. Roses of remembrance... Where can I find some?CEDRIC: Proceed south through the forest, all the way to the lake. Beware of the endregas and nekkers, and the traps that I\\'ve set. Nearby, on a plateau, you\\'ll find the garden of Eldan and Cymoril...GERALT: Liquor will kill you, Cedric... You should drink less.CEDRIC: I prefer this fog to madness. Wouldn’t you?[Geralt goes to the elven ruins Cáelmewedd and retrieves a rose. He brings it back to Triss at the tavern.]GERALT: Triss... I found a rose of remembrance.TRISS: Hmmm... I bet it\\'s beautiful there.GERALT: Might\\'ve been at one time. Now it\\'s just plain sad.TRISS: I need time to devise the spell. It could take as much as a few days.GERALT: Mm-hmm.TRISS: What do you plan to do while you wait?GERALT: I\\'m going to meet Iorveth.TRISS: Well don\\'t get yourself killed - that\\'d be pretty stupid now.GERALT: What\\'re you getting at?TRISS: You\\'re about to recover your memory, which will give you a whole new perspective on things. We\\'ll learn what happened to Yennefer...GERALT: Uh-huh. And you expect me to drop everything and tell Roche, \\'Hey, it\\'s been great, but I\\'ve got places to go and people to find\\'?TRISS: You know you could. I-I mean, you don\\'t really owe him anything.TRISS: I\\'m just afraid you\\'ll get caught up in something and you won\\'t be able to back out. Iorveth\\'s a sly old elf, he\\'s been fighting humans for a full century at least... This Letho is no common bandit either, and I shudder to think who put him on the warpath... It\\'s a mire, Geralt, deep and hungry, and it could swallow you whole before you know it.GERALT: It possibly already has.TRISS: I want you to know that I\\'m prepared to travel to the end of the world with you to save Yennefer. I owe you that, I owe her that... I\\'m prepared to drop everything - the trappings of court life, politics, the regicides... I could even live at Kaer Morhen. It\\'s up to you.GERALT: Triss...TRISS: Let me finish - I can only say this once: If you want to go alone, I\\'ll understand... and I won\\'t try to persuade you otherwise.I don\\'t want to lose you. GERALT: I can\\'t know what the future holds. I don\\'t know what else is hidden in my mind. But whatever it is, whatever happens, I don’t want to lose you. I\\'d have to be an utter fool and complete ingrate to let you go.TRISS: That\\'s kind, thank you... Does that mean we\\'re leaving the regicides to Roche and tending to our own matters?I can\\'t. GERALT: I really would like to go, but I need to clear my name. Foltest\\'s men and bounty hunters of all kinds would never let it go. We\\'d be fugitives - and that\\'s not a life I\\'d want for me or for you.GERALT: Besides, I\\'d feel as if I\\'d given up when there was still something to do. I\\'d feel like I fled. And as I see it, we haven\\'t lost yet.TRISS: Whatever your decision, I want you to know you can count on me. I need a few days to prepare the spells.GERALT: I need to talk to Zoltan about Iorveth. It\\'s not a closed conversation - we\\'ll talk again, but only after I\\'ve settled things with the kingslayer.I guess so. GERALT: I think so... And I think you\\'re right - I don\\'t owe anyone anything.TRISS: I\\'m glad you\\'ve noticed that.GERALT: But that doesn\\'t mean I\\'m willing to sit around doing nothing. You need time anyway, and in that time I\\'ll catch the kingslayer.TRISS: Geralt, please be careful.GERALT: I\\'ll go see Zoltan, and together we\\'ll go find Iorveth. With a little luck, I\\'ll capture the kingslayer, and then... we can go back to living our own lives.TRISS: Good. Will you talk to Roche?GERALT: I\\'ll think about it...I\\'ll catch the kingslayer before you finish your preparations. GERALT: If all goes well, I\\'ll catch the kingslayer before you finish preparing the spells...TRISS: And if it doesn\\'t go well?GERALT: Triss, do you really expect me to spend two days at the tavern drinking with the locals while Letho\\'s out there taking control of a Scoia\\'tael unit...?TRISS: No. But what will you do? What if Iorveth scoffs at your news, what he says Letho\\'s escaped and no one knows where to find him? Will we go? Will we leave the regicide to Roche and continue with our own lives?You know I can\\'t. [Same as \"I can\\'t\" above.]I guess so. [Same as \"I guess so.\" above.]I need to think this through. GERALT: I gotta give this some thought.TRISS: You\\'ve got time. A few days.GERALT: And I think best while doing. I\\'ll meet with Iorveth. With a little luck, I should be able to capture the kingslayer before you\\'ve finished your preparations.TRISS: If you say so.GERALT: Once I\\'ve recovered my memory, we\\'ll decide what to do.[If Geralt agrees to leave with Triss, he can go talk to Roche in the tavern to inform him.]GERALT: A few days from now, I plan to leave, get back on the Path, back to my witcher\\'s work. That\\'ll mean the end of our mission.ROCHE: Care to tell me what prompted this decision?GERALT: Triss - she knows how to restore my memory.ROCHE: Why not drop everything and leave now?GERALT: Triss needs time to prepare the spells.ROCHE: You\\'re giving up... No other name for it - you\\'re just giving up. What of the kingslayer? Many still believe you\\'re him.GERALT: I don\\'t think I care anymore. Those whose opinions I value, well, they know the truth.ROCHE: Uh-uh. You see someone kick a dog and you\\'re incapable of letting it go. And you want to release that fiend who we\\'ve succeeded in cornering, who\\'s thrashing to get out of the cage we’ve put up around him?GERALT: I want nothing of the sort. I\\'m not leaving for a few more days. In that time I\\'ll catch Letho for you. That\\'s the kingslayer\\'s name, incidentally... I know how to get him.ROCHE: How?GERALT: You\\'re not going to like this, but it\\'ll involve working with the Scoia\\'tael...ROCHE: Is your mind completely ploughed at this point? Did Triss put this nonsense in your head?GERALT: Listen to me... You\\'ll get your kingslayer soon. I\\'ll give you him or his head. After which you\\'ll clear me of all charges and let me go my way.ROCHE: What else? Perhaps you\\'d like me to embrace Iorveth in gratitude as well?GERALT: Iorveth\\'s not my problem. I\\'m no elf hunter. I\\'ve never been one, and I don\\'t intend to become one.ROCHE: Oh, enough... You\\'ve made your decision - I can see that. So be it... But I think we all know who\\'s being the prick here.[This concludes the quest.][If Geralt asks Triss to accompany him, they go together to the waterfall.]TRISS: Ugh... I think we\\'ve arrived. The cascade, the menhir. We need to take the path leading upwards.GERALT: Gardens in the middle of forests... Those elves really liked to complicate things.TRISS: Stop whining. It\\'s not far now.TRISS: Cedric told me a beautiful legend about this place.GERALT: Legends are almost always beautiful, especially elven ones. The reality often leaves a lot to be desired.TRISS: Well, Cedric also said the site itself was something wonderful.TRISS: The rose must be here somewhere.GERALT: I\\'ll look around.TRISS: Eldan and Cymoril. Cedric said Cymoril eclipsed even Francesca Findabair with her beauty, and Francesca\\'s reputed to be the world\\'s most beautiful woman.GERALT: Cedric drinks too much.TRISS: He really has visions, you know. He really has the gift. He could learn to control it if he drank less...GERALT: Cedric drinks to get rid of the visions. And that\\'s something I understand perfectly well.[Triss and Geralt come to Eldan and Cymoril\\'s garden and stop in front of the statue of the two lovers.]TRISS: Oh my. Lovers... Look, Geralt, it\\'s beautiful.GERALT: Mhm.TRISS: I just don\\'t understand it. How did the elves become so cruel? The one with the scar had so much hatred in him.GERALT: Places like this make you realize just how much they\\'ve lost... There used to be entire elven cities, and the forests were theirs to enjoy, not to hide in. Humans destroyed that, put them in reservations. Iorveth and his kind are taking revenge, though not all elves are like that.TRISS: Ciaran said there\\'s a lot more at stake...GERALT: He has his ideal, a certain vision of the world, but do you think there\\'s room for humans in it?TRISS: We\\'re practically one and the same.GERALT: Wrong, Triss. We\\'ve been learning from each other for generations, but we\\'re different at base.TRISS: I don\\'t know why I find that awfully sad.GERALT: Just like this garden. Beautiful and sad.[Geralt picks a flower.]GERALT: Triss...TRISS: Cymoril\\'s rose of remembrance... Legend has it they wilt unless nourished with blood, and also if they\\'re sold... But give it to someone you love, and it\\'ll live forever.Here. GERALT: This one\\'s for you.TRISS: Ohh, Geralt...GERALT: I want you to keep it. If there\\'s any truth to the legend, it shouldn\\'t wilt, even if you pluck a petal or two.TRISS: Thank you.That\\'s not fair. GERALT: Well, this is awkward...TRISS: Oh, please, Geralt. It\\'s just some stupid elven story. Give me the rose before you break it.GERALT: It\\'s not stupid, it\\'s just that...[A trio of bandits enter the garden.]BANDIT 1: This is the statue, Curly.BANDIT 1: Don\\'t mind us.BANDIT 1: Imagine the coin we\\'ll get. I won\\'t leave the brothel for a month.BANDIT 2: Six weeks, even.BANDIT 1: Where does that woman get the gold for all this? I mean, her and the old man - they\\'re buying a new house, and now these statues for the garden. Must be defrawing the treasury. What\\'s a town chancellor do, anyway?BANDIT 2: It\\'ll be ploughing hard to move.BANDIT 1: We\\'d never shift it in one piece. I know - we\\'ll break off the legs, the heads, remove it in bits.TRISS: Break off your own head, clown!BANDIT 3: Shut your trap, cunt.[Geralt and Triss have to fight the bandits. As Geralt kills the last one, a fourth one appears from over the wall and ambushes Triss. Geralt leaps forward to save her, and both he and Triss end up falling through the ground into an elven bathhouse.]TRISS: Incredible what the Aen Seidhe built before human ships ever appeared in the Pontar Delta. Elves possess a sensitivity humans can\\'t ever hope to acquire.TRISS: Looks like we\\'re stuck.GERALT: Mhm.TRISS: There must be another way out of here.GERALT: Mhm.TRISS: Why\\'re you looking at me that way? Do I have something on my face?GERALT: Nuh-uh.TRISS: What\\'s going on in that head of yours, witcher?Nothing. Let\\'s get out of here. GERALT: Nothing, sorry. We need to find another way out.TRISS: Are you all right, Geralt?GERALT: Yeah, I\\'m fine. We should look for that exit.GERALT: Any Scoia\\'tael scouts in the area heard the sounds of the fighting. They won\\'t miss that hole we dropped through either...TRISS: And here I thought I was the cautious one...GERALT: Did you say something?TRISS: No, nothing.You could use a bath. GERALT: Oh, you know, stuff. You could use a bath.TRISS: So could you.[If Geralt chooses \"You could use a bath\": Triss and Geralt get intimate in the bath. Above them, Scoia\\'tael enter the garden and stop to examine the bandits\\' bodies. One is an elf, Hearvihen, and the other a dwarf, Zagen.]HEARVIHEN: A witcher\\'s blade. Letho comes here to think...ZAGEN: Well, he\\'s not here now, so we\\'ve no reason to stay.HEARVIHEN: The dh\\'oine stole the story of Eldan and Cymoril, as they now steal our roses of remembrance. A more silly and shallow tale I\\'ve never heard. An enchanted wood, a beautiful elven couple living within, a handsome, human prince arrives, riding a milk white stallion... Bloede dh\\'oine!HEARVIHEN: We Aen Seidhe remember how it was... Limitless devotion, passion, commitment... and sacrifice. Legend has it the lovers\\' sighs are enchanted within these very stones, though only those in love can hear them.[The Scoia\\'tael turn to leave.]ZAGEN: Singing bushes... jabbering stones... Elven hogwash. [pauses, hears the sound of Triss moaning] Well, I\\'m buggered.[Geralt and Triss get dressed.]TRISS: We should take walks more often. For a while there, I forgot all about Flotsam, the Scoia\\'tael, the kingslayer, the whole world, really...GERALT: Nice to know I still have that power...[Initiates the \"I need time to devise the spell.\" conversation. After Geralt has either agreed or disagreed with Triss, a muffled voice can be heard shouting.]ROCHE: Geralt! Geralt![One of the walls crumbles, and Roche bursts through.]ROCHE: There you are. Is everything all right?ROCHE: This is nice...ROCHE: What a beautiful place.TRISS: Very...GERALT: How\\'d you find us?ROCHE: Finding those I seek is a speciality of mine. Now let\\'s get out of here - the Scoia\\'tael are out in droves.GERALT: Wait, Vernon. We need to talk.ROCHE: About what?[If you didn\\'t agree with Triss] GERALT: Actually, it can wait...ROCHE: Fine, then. Let\\'s get out of here.[If you agreed with Triss] [Plays out the same as the tavern conversation.][Choosing \"Nothing. Let\\'s get out of here\" initiates the \"I need time to devise the spell\" conversation. After Geralt either agrees or disagrees with triss, he breaks the wall with Aard, and he and Triss climb up to the surface. The trio of Scoia\\'tael have not left yet.]HEARVIHEN: A witcher\\'s blade. Letho... He comes here to think.ZAGEN: I don\\'t give a goat\\'s balls what that rogue does for leisure. Can we go, or do you need to ponder some rocks?HEARVIHEN: Eldan and Cymoril. A beautiful story that humans turned into a shallow lie. Bloede dh\\'oine!ZAGEN: I know, I know... humans are scoundrels and pricks. You ready?HEARVIHEN: But we Aen Seidhe remember how it was, the limitless devotion, passion... and sacrifice.ZAGEN: Please stop, poetry irks me.HEARVIHEN: Legend has it the lovers\\' sighs are enchanted within these very stones, though only those in love can hear them.ZAGEN: Singing bushes... jabbering stones... Elven hogwash.[Geralt and Triss emerge.]HEARVIHEN: Dh\\'oine!GERALT: Caelm, Seidhe... We\\'re not looking for a fight.ZAGEN: Hear that, Hearvihen? A few words of Elder and he thinks he can go.HEARVIHEN: This is elven land, dh\\'oine, upon which your kind dies.Let us leave in peace. GERALT: There\\'s no need to fight. We\\'ll leave your land in peace.ZAGEN: Unbelievable! Spits in your face and claims it\\'s raining!HEARVIHEN: Shut up, Zagen. Speak, dh\\'oine: whose are those corpses?I don\\'t like your tone. GERALT: I\\'m not explaining myself to you, elf. Stand and fight.HEARVIHEN: I was hoping you\\'d say that.[Results in a fight.][PERSUASION] They came here to steal the statue. GERALT: They tried to take the statue. We persuaded them otherwise.[FAILURE] HEARVIHEN: You could\\'ve said they attacked you.ZAGEN: Or that it was a drunken brawl.HEARVIHEN: But a dh\\'oine killing other dh\\'oine to protect elven statues? Pff...![SUCCESS] HEARVIHEN: Be that as it may... Why did you come here?GERALT: We wanted to see this place, nothing more.ZAGEN: Nothing worth stealing around here.HEARVIHEN: Now you\\'ve seen it, go! Before I have a change of heart.ZAGEN: You\\'re setting \\'em free, Hearvihen?HEARVIHEN: Go.[AXII] Thieves. I took care of them. GERALT: Petty robbers from the trading post. I took care of them.[FAILURE] HEARVIHEN: Your tricks will not save you, dh\\'oine.[SUCCESS] [Same as for Persuasion.][INTIMIDATION] I\\'ve had enough killing for today. GERALT: I\\'ve had enough killing for today.[FAILURE] HEARVIHEN: Truly? You should not have come here.[SUCCESS] HEARVIHEN: Leave this place. We\\'ll have no more bloodshed here.Show me what you got. [Results in a fight.][The Scoia\\'tael either leave or are killed by Geralt and Triss.]GERALT: Fresh air.TRISS: I\\'m glad you asked me along - that was edifying.GERALT: Really? What did you you learn?TRISS: You know why Eldan and Cymoril resisted all and stayed together?GERALT: Why?TRISS: Because they\\'re statues. Just statues...GERALT: Triss...[Once they leave the garden, if Geralt agreed with Triss, he can meet with Roche in the tavern and tell him about his decision to leave with Triss. This concludes the quest.]  3.9 - Zoltan the Squirrel < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[After retrieving a rose of remembrance, Geralt talks to Zoltan in the tavern.]GERALT: Zoltan, I need to ask you a favor.ZOLTAN: Shoot.GERALT: I heard you know the local Scoia\\'tael.ZOLTAN: You heard? Meaning some goat\\'s arse in a helmet hollered it out in the market square?GERALT: I need some way to get to this Iorveth.[If the kayran isn\\'t dead, Zoltan says one of these things] ZOLTAN: Perhaps I could help, but as long as this ploughing ban remains in force, I can\\'t stick my beak outside Flotsam\\'s gates.ZOLTAN: We can go just as soon as I finish this trinket for Síle. That megascope of hers - delicate as a maiden\\'s confidence. One tiny flaw on the diamond, and - poof! - it\\'s liable to crumble. Don\\'t you worry. The Scoia\\'tael won\\'t go anywhere. I\\'m sure you can find a way to be useful in the meantime.ZOLTAN: I\\'ve some minor details to fine tune. Don\\'t hold it against me. If I don\\'t finish, the rag\\'s likely to tell Loredo I\\'m uncooperative, and I don\\'t want that trouble again.[If the kayran is dead] ZOLTAN: You know... I don\\'t want you thinkin\\' I\\'m all chummy with the Scoia\\'tael. And Iorveth detests me. Why would you want to see him, anyway?GERALT: He knows where the kingslayer is.ZOLTAN: Iorveth? And here I always thought him a common thug. All right, no reason to sit on our arses. Come on - you can tell me everythin\\' on the way.[Geralt follows Zoltan.]GERALT: Lead on, Zoltan.ZOLTAN: Tell me, who said I have contacts with the Scoia\\'tael?GERALT: Loredo.ZOLTAN: What a prick.GERALT: That\\'s why he wanted to hang you - for making deals with the Squirrels?ZOLTAN: What?! I met a few, yes, but made no fucking deals.GERALT: What about their leader?ZOLTAN: They say Iorveth\\'s mad, but the Scoia\\'tael are at his beck and call. Sod knows what he wants.GERALT: Hope he\\'ll tell me what it is.ZOLTAN: Tell you what, of two evils, Loredo\\'s the bigger prick.GERALT: Because he almost hanged you?ZOLTAN: Because he stirs up the locals against nonhumans. And there\\'s word he\\'s colluding with Kaedwen.GERALT: What\\'s his angle?ZOLTAN: Greed. King Henselt would gladly annex more land and grant Loredo privileges. Come on, we\\'ve got a long way to go.ZOLTAN: We need to go deeper into the forest. I hope they didn\\'t change the password.GERALT: You know their password? What\\'re you playing at, Zoltan?ZOLTAN: All right... The Scoia\\'tael asked me to command a unit.GERALT: No wonder Loredo wanted you hanged.ZOLTAN: Ah, they may have asked, but I didn\\'t accept their fucking offer![They stop at a shrine in the forest.]ZOLTAN: This is it. I was due to meet them here.GERALT: I know. They\\'re aiming arrows at us.ZOLTAN: What? Geralt, I know full well you\\'re always vigilant, but quit poking fun at me.GERALT: Give them the password.ZOLTAN: What \\'them\\'?GERALT: Hurry up. They\\'re edgy.ZOLTAN: Kier-ke-gaard![Two Scoia\\'tael approach.]ELE\\'YAS: Stop bawling. What do you want?ZOLTAN: Countersign.ELE\\'YAS: Hei-de-gger. I asked you a question.ZOLTAN: Take us to Iorveth.ELE\\'YAS: Why?GERALT: If we wanted to speak with you, we wouldn\\'t ask for your leader.ELE\\'YAS: Iorveth won\\'t talk with you.GERALT: You don\\'t know that.ELE\\'YAS: Leave while you\\'re still able.ZOLTAN: The two of you won\\'t scare us off.GERALT: There are four more in that tree.ELE\\'YAS: How do you know?GERALT: I can hear them breathing. One\\'s sick or on fisstech.ELE\\'YAS: How...?GERALT: He\\'s wheezing.ZOLTAN: What? You elven cocks gone soft?GERALT: We just want to talk to Iorveth.ELE\\'YAS: Wait at the clearing - the dwarf knows where. We\\'ll let Iorveth know.ZOLTAN: Make sure you do. Come on, Geralt.ZOLTAN: I know what those elven pricks have planned. Been there once.GERALT: What are you talking about?ZOLTAN: That clearing is a monster\\'s lair. Huge whoreson with a shell on its back.GERALT: An arachas in these parts? I thought that was impossible.ZOLTAN: I don\\'t know the shit\\'s name, but it\\'s terrifying. They sent us into a trap.GERALT: Tough. Let\\'s go.[They come to the ledge above the clearing where Iorveth fed a nekker to the arachas.]ZOLTAN: We\\'re here. That creature prowls down there.GERALT: Right where we\\'re supposed to meet Iorveth.ZOLTAN: Exactly! Any ideas?GERALT: [shrugs] I last fought an arachas some time ago.ZOLTAN: I never had the swiving pleasure. Not that I mind.GERALT: Wait here...ZOLTAN: What are you...? Think me a limp prick?[Geralt and Zoltan descend into the clearing. The arachas scuttles out of its lair.]ZOLTAN: This is the place the elves mentioned.GERALT: That thing approaching us is no elf.ZOLTAN: I\\'ll leave it to you, Geralt. Monsters are not my speciality.[As soon as the arachas falls, Scoia\\'tael leap out of hiding, fixing bows on Zoltan and Geralt. Iorveth emerges.]IORVETH: A lovely show, Gwynbleidd. But tell me, was it worth it? An uneven fight, and certain death await you anyway.GERALT: I could ask you the same thing.IORVETH: What do you want, vatt\\'ghern? Speak quickly, before I kill you both.You\\'re a murderer. GERALT: You\\'re a bandit, Iorveth - a thief and murderer. No wonder the Commandant wants to get you.IORVETH: I am who I need to be.[He turns to go, and the Scoia\\'tael fire on Geralt and Zoltan.]Let Zoltan go. GERALT: Let Zoltan go, Iorveth. You have me.IORVETH: I have you both. A witcher, apparently seeking an ugly death... And a dwarven traitor, spitting on the honor of his folk.ZOLTAN: Know what I spit on, you divot? On you bloody squirts, riff-raff killing innocent men!IORVETH: Innocent men? So agitated when you shout that, it\\'s even funny.Loredo was right about you. GERALT: Loredo was right. Peace is impossible as long as you live.IORVETH: Geralt of Rivia - the Commandant\\'s bloodhound. In which case die, you pitiful little dh\\'oine.[The Scoia\\'tael kill Geralt and Zoltan.]I want Letho. GERALT: I want the kingslayer. Letho, the man whose crimes I\\'m accused of.IORVETH: If you hadn\\'t become Foltest\\'s lackey, you wouldn\\'t have been there when he was murdered. Do you really expect me to betray a useful ally?As an apology for the assault at the riverbank. GERALT: You attacked us on the riverbank for no reason. You owe me.IORVETH: Not so. The only dh\\'oine I owe anything is Roche, but believe me, I shall pay that debt soon.Letho wants you dead. GERALT: Letho betrayed you. He wanted to make a deal with your comrade, Ciaran.IORVETH: Ciaran aep Easnillen is dead. Two weeks ago his warriors were ambushed and killed. You should invent better lies, Gwynbleidd.GERALT: He\\'s on the barge. Wounded, but alive. He turned Letho down, and his unit paid the ultimate price.IORVETH: If you speak the truth, Letho will die. But words alone are not enough.Letho wants you dead. [Same as above.]What are you really fighting for? GERALT: What\\'s your angle, Iorveth?IORVETH: You wouldn\\'t understand.GERALT: Hiding in woods, killing berry-pickers, eating roots...IORVETH: We live by our own rules, doing what\\'s necessary to attain our goal.You\\'ve lost everything. GERALT: So it\\'s pride that keeps you sneaking around woods and sleeping in ditches? You\\'ve fallen low, Aen Seidhe.IORVETH: Watch your words, Gwynbleidd.What\\'s at the end of your path? [Same as \"What is this goal?\"]You\\'re a disgrace to your race. GERALT: Self-appointed heroes like you will doom your race.IORVETH: Perhaps. But you won\\'t live to see it. Va fail, vatt\\'ghern.[The Scoia\\'tael kill Geralt and Zoltan.]What is this goal? GERALT: What is your goal?IORVETH: What\\'s it to you, Geralt? Esseath vatt\\'ghern... You\\'d tell me to stuff it up my arse.GERALT: Not everything deserves that fate. My life now depends on your whim, so I\\'m curious.IORVETH: Then listen well. The two dead kings were whoresons who\\'d damn their own children to stay in power. But in the east there\\'s someone truly deserving of a crown.What\\'s your connection to the kingslayer? GERALT: So, the hired assassin turned out to be a traitor...IORVETH: It\\'s his word against yours...GERALT: For now. Why do you trust him? Because he\\'s a dh\\'oine who agreed to do shady work for you?IORVETH: He did what had to be done. He proved nobody\\'s untouchable.There are nonhumans living in Flotsam. GERALT: You attack and murder the people of Flotsam, forgetting that elves and dwarves live among them.IORVETH: That\\'s no life! They\\'ve been stripped of self-respect, forced to live and die by human laws. They\\'re more dh\\'oine than you, Geralt.What will you do with Letho? GERALT: You still trust this assassin?IORVETH: You may be lying...GERALT: If I\\'m lying, so did Ciaran.IORVETH: We\\'ll investigate it for his sake. We shall see how Letho reacts to your sensational news.GERALT: Where is he?IORVETH: The ruins of Cáelmewedd. For some reason he likes the place. My unit will cover us. Ready?GERALT: Why did you want Foltest dead?IORVETH: He might have appeared charming, but in reality he allowed the elder races in Temeria to be oppressed. He was like all dh\\'oine, but his death has more significance.Let\\'s go. GERALT: We need to go.I need to do something first. GERALT: Let\\'s meet there. I have something to take care of first.IORVETH: Va fail, Gwynbleidd. Just don\\'t try any tricks...ZOLTAN: We came here together, we\\'re leaving together.GERALT: No, Zoltan. Your presence might raise suspicions.ZOLTAN: As you wish. Just don\\'t get slaughtered.  3.10 - Confronting Letho < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt and Iorveth arrive at the elven ruins of Cáelmewedd.]IORVETH: We need a ruse. Tell Letho you\\'ve captured me and want to hand me over to him.GERALT: And you?IORVETH: I\\'ll be unarmed, hands bound. If you\\'re not lying, his reaction will confirm it. I don\\'t trust you, of course. My warriors will cover us. If you try anything stupid...GERALT: I get it.IORVETH: I don’t think so. Do anything stupid and they\\'ll tie you down on an anthill, face coated with honey. You\\'ll scream so loud even the storm riders will hear you.GERALT: Are you always so grandiose? We could just tell Letho to own up.IORVETH: Ayd f\\'haeil moen Hirjeth taenverde.GERALT: Conquer with courage rather than strength?IORVETH: [sarcastic clapping] Exactly. Let\\'s go.[Geralt and Iorveth make their way into the garden.]IORVETH: My warriors observe us. One wrong move and you\\'re a dead dh\\'oine.IORVETH: Be careful. Letho is incredibly quick.IORVETH: Make sure you don\\'t betray our ruse.IORVETH: If he\\'s betrayed me, Letho is a dead man.[Letho is sitting at the base of the statue when Geralt and Iorveth arrive.]LETHO: Geralt of Rivia... What\\'s the meaning of this?GERALT: I\\'m here to negotiate.LETHO: Ah! Iorveth, the woodland fox, caught at last. I underestimated you.You\\'ll answer for regicide. GERALT: You killed Foltest. You\\'ll answer for that.LETHO: You\\'re the only one who saw it happen. You\\'ll do the answering.What\\'s your connection to Iorveth? GERALT: I wondered what a human was doing among the Scoia\\'tael.LETHO: \\'My enemy\\'s enemy is my friend.\\' Know the saying? The Scoia\\'tael are my brothers in vengeance.Who are you? GERALT: Who are you?LETHO: You really don\\'t remember?GERALT: I\\'m sick of that question.LETHO: So it\\'s true. And here I feared that you\\'d ruin it all. I am Letho of Gulet. I\\'m a kingslayer.Who do you work for? GERALT: Tell me who you\\'re working for and the elf is yours.LETHO: We work for ourselves.GERALT: We?LETHO: The kingslayers.Why are you killing kings? GERALT: Demavend, Foltest... Who else? Who the hell are you?LETHO: We\\'ve met, Geralt. Do you remember?GERALT: No...LETHO: I\\'ll never forget it. You saved my life, White Wolf. We fought side by side, now we\\'ll cross blades. This wouldn\\'t be necessary if I\\'d killed Iorveth first.IORVETH: Serrit and Auckes will drown in their own blood.LETHO: Oh, I don\\'t think so. My men will finish their task long before the Scoia\\'tael in the Pontar Valley realize you\\'re dead.Who are Serrit and Auckes? GERALT: Serrit and Auckes - who are they?IORVETH: Kingslayers the Scoia\\'tael are assisting in the Pontar Valley, in Upper Aedirn.I\\'ve spoken to Ciaran. GERALT: Ciaran aep Easnillen told me you want to eliminate Iorveth.LETHO: Even if I do, why would you help me?IORVETH: Bloede dh\\'oine.Draw your sword. GERALT: I don\\'t see any other way to do this... Draw your sword.We don\\'t have to fight. GERALT: This doesn\\'t need to end in blood. Tell me everything.IORVETH: Enough of this farce! Vedrai! Enn\\'le![Scoia\\'tael leap out.]LETHO: What game are you playing?GERALT: One that you just lost.[A Scoia\\'tael falls to a crossbow bolt. Roche and the Blue Stripes join the fray.]IORVETH: Give me my sword.[Help Roche.] [Geralt punches Iorveth in the face, knocking him out.][Give Iorveth his sword]. [Geralt throws Iorveth his weapon.]IORVETH: Die...[Iorveth clashes with Roche.]ROCHE: Get the kingslayer!LETHO: I have to kill you.GERALT: Try it. But I\\'m no king.[Geralt and Letho tumble into the bathhouse below.]LETHO: Such a pity we\\'re on opposite sides.LETHO: I see you still know how to fight.LETHO: Why do you hound me?GERALT: They think I killed Foltest!LETHO: It\\'s your own fault for playing soldier boy.GERALT: Why would a witcher kill kings?LETHO: I\\'m a witcher no more. That was long ago.GERALT: So you\\'re a hired thug now? Congratulations!GERALT: Should\\'ve surrendered when you could.LETHO: You fight well, but you were better once.GERALT: The muscles remember.LETHO: One thing the Wild Hunt couldn\\'t take from you.GERALT: A witcher and a few elves are enough to kill a king?[Letho\\'s Aard sends Geralt flying across the room, sword knocked from his hand. Letho picks it up.]LETHO: You\\'ve no idea how many people were eager to help us.GERALT: You really think they will all keep quiet?LETHO: Iorveth\\'s time is running out.

They\\'ve killed one of my girls...DANDELION: It\\'s Derae, Geralt. That was her room.GERALT: What happened?MARGOT: They murdered her. Yesterday they loved her, drank wine with her, told her she\\'s pretty... Today, five of them came, drunk on blood, screaming filth.GERALT: She had a client at the time?MARGOT: No, she was with me. What\\'re you looking at? I was consoling her...GERALT: I was hoping you knew what happened in the next room. I noticed a peephole, but if you were busy...MARGOT: We were, until we heard voices beyond the wall. Síle normally cast spells that blocked both sight and sound, but there was nothing like that this time.MARGOT: We started peeping - me first. I saw that redhead, Triss Merigold, and Cedric, our drunkard ex-Squirrel. The redhead approached the magic mirror and said, \\'Let\\'s see who our ice queen\\'s been talking to recently.\\'DANDELION: She meant Síle.MARGOT: Even I figured that out. She waved her hands, shouted an incantation, and a man appeared in the room. Mighty ugly - Derae was so scared she squealed. When I finally got Derae out of the way, a different figure was in the room. A woman Triss called \\'Philippa.\\'[A flashback to Derae and Margot peeping. On the other side of the wall, Triss converses with a sorceress.]TRISS: Greetings, Philippa.PHILIPPA: Triss... You\\'re looking nice. Why are you using Síle\\'s megascope? I can\\'t believe she approved it. That\\'s like using her toothbrush.TRISS: Síle\\'s oblivious to it.What did Síle want from you? TRISS: What did Síle want from you?PHILIPPA: Isn\\'t it obvious? Two Northern rulers have perished. We\\'ve been thinking on these developments.TRISS: Temeria is in chaos and I lost my position. There goes the effort we put into building peace! What\\'s your intention? What has the Lodge decided? I mean, it was created to protect the interests of magic.PHILIPPA: We\\'ll adjust to the new order and make use of this situation.TRISS: Five years of my work wasted! The Peace of Cintra hangs by a thread and Temeria will plunge into civil war any day now! There\\'s nothing to use! We need to find those responsible and dispense justice!PHILIPPA: Calm down. Two things should be partaken cold - sorrel soup and politics. Calculate and don\\'t let your emotions lead you. We can\\'t resurrect Foltest, so stop playing the avenger. We\\'ll proceed wisely and deliberately. We\\'ll use the situation. Understand?TRISS: At least help me clear the witcher\\'s name.PHILIPPA: Triss, stop thinking with your vagina and get a hold of yourself. The witcher will manage...The girl from Aedirn... TRISS: Do you think the girl...PHILIPPA: Saskia the Dragonslayer! Legend has it she killed a dragon!TRISS: Can she oppose Henselt\\'s might?PHILIPPA: It won\\'t be easy, but she\\'s already accomplished miracles.TRISS: So war is inevitable?PHILIPPA: Henselt can\\'t be reasoned with.What\\'s Síle doing in Flotsam? TRISS: Why did Síle come to Flotsam?PHILIPPA: It\\'s a delicate matter. We need someone at Henselt\\'s court, but he hates sorceresses...TRISS: I know.PHILIPPA: Henselt\\'s only son died in a hunting accident three years ago. The king has failed to sire more offspring, in spite of trying incessantly. Síle claims she can heal the king\\'s faulty \\'apparatus,\\' but needs very rare ingredients.TRISS: Which she intends to harvest from the kayran.PHILIPPA: Exactly. This way a sorceress will have the king\\'s ear again.Where are you, now? TRISS: I heard you left Redania.PHILIPPA: I intend to stop Aedirn from falling apart. There\\'s a popular uprising here, a real fight for freedom. You\\'d like it...TRISS: I doubt it.PHILIPPA: It had started before Demavend\\'s death. The rebels are led by a girl - both beautiful and smart. She\\'s achieved the impossible - humans and nonhumans, nobles, burghers and peasants, marching side by side towards a new beginning...PHILIPPA: They gave the royalists a heavy thrashing. Now they\\'re the only armed force in Aedirn.TRISS: What happened to Demavend\\'s son, Prince Stennis?PHILIPPA: He\\'s joined the rebellion and makes a virtue of necessity. He pretends to like the idea of equality and justice.TRISS: What\\'s your intention?PHILIPPA: To stop Henselt of Kaedwen conquering Upper Aedirn. Our bellicose king would become too powerful. That\\'s for a start. Then I\\'ll need to ensure the right individual ascends to the Aedirnian throne.[Flashback ends.]MARGOT: That\\'s all I know, really...Dandelion, who\\'s Philippa? GERALT: Dandelion, who\\'s Philippa? Do you know her?DANDELION: Philippa Eilhart - a sorceress counselor to King Radovid of Redania. She\\'s a grand mistress of the world\\'s most fetid cuisine - politics.DANDELION: She\\'s amoral in a crystalline way, so devoid of conscience that she\\'s a phenomenon. Rumor is she\\'s out of favor at the Redanian court, which, if true, she probably arranged herself in order to leave the capital.What happened to Triss? GERALT: What happened to Triss?MARGOT: I don\\'t know. I already told you about the only conversation I heard... just before those murderers came. They kicked me and stabbed Derae. But I heard fighting from the other room - the sorceress was screaming.MARGOT: When the murderers left, searching for other victims, I peered outside. Thought I saw Cedric sneaking through the alleys, towards the forest. He was staggering.GERALT: Thank you, Margot. I owe you.MARGOT: Witcher, wait. Give this to Iorveth.GERALT: A letter?MARGOT: The names of Derae\\'s killers. He\\'ll understand.You\\'re spying for Iorveth? GERALT: You\\'re spying for Iorveth?MARGOT: I help him from time to time. Just give him the letter.GERALT: I\\'ll try, but I can\\'t promise anything.I don\\'t want to be party to murder. GERALT: I\\'d rather not get involved...MARGOT: Those bastards deserve punishment.GERALT: True. But I won\\'t be party to another murder.MARGOT: Will you turn me in?GERALT: No. You\\'ve got nothing to worry about.I don\\'t intend to see Iorveth. GERALT: I\\'m not going to meet Iorveth.MARGOT: Will you turn me in?GERALT: No. Don\\'t worry.GERALT: Dandelion, wait here for me.

I know you looked through the peephole.DERAE: Margot was nervous about the holiday, she told the girls to give freebies today. Then she took me to me room and we made love. Just as I was, I was, well.... Well, we heard voices and Margot started spying. It was the sorceress and Cedric.DANDELION: Are you sure?DERAE: Yes. We started fighting for the peephole, but finally Margot let me take a peek. Triss said she was going to see who the \\'ice queen\\' had spoken to recently. She approached the mirror and whispered something. There was a flash, and a terrible looking man popped out of the mirror.DANDELION: What did he look like?DERAE: Like a wyrm. A hungry, old wyrm.DANDELION: Huh. I wonder...DERAE: Triss was aghast, and the wyrm said, \"Why so pale, Merigold? Have you seen a ghost?\" Then he smiled maliciously, and...[A flashback to Derae and Margot peeping. On the other side of the wall, Triss converses with a sorcerer.]DETHMOLD: Why so pale, Merigold? Seen a ghost? What is it now?TRISS: Greetings, Dethmold. I wondered who Síle had been talking to, recently...DETHMOLD: Spying on each other, eh? That\\'s new. What\\'s your business?You spoke to Síle. TRISS: What did Síle want from you?DETHMOLD: Why would I tell you?TRISS: Because you hate her and only dislike me. You wouldn\\'t miss the tiniest chance to make her life miserable.DETHMOLD: Ah-heh. You\\'re right. Síle wants to unsaddle me - to take my place at Henselt\\'s side.TRISS: Henselt hates sorceresses.DETHMOLD: Henselt lost his son and is having problems siring an heir. He\\'s no longer a young man. She promised him offspring. Said she\\'d guarantee a child if he finds a young, strong woman. He\\'d just need to...TRISS: I know where children come from.DETHMOLD: Prove she\\'s lying and I\\'ll be most appreciative.TRISS: I can\\'t, which means you\\'ve got a problem.DETHMOLD: Slow down. I still play first fiddle, you know.Know anything about the kingslayer? TRISS: I\\'m pursuing the kingslayer. Maybe you\\'ve heard something...DETHMOLD: Oooh, that gives me the chills... Whoever he is, he\\'s done for.TRISS: You\\'ll change your mind when the kingslayer nails your ruler.DETHMOLD: Merigold, think as befits a mage, because right now you bring shame to all sorcerers. Foltest is dead. It\\'s your fault and, as rumor has it, your witcher lover\\'s, too.TRISS: You don\\'t believe that.DETHMOLD: What I believe matters little - the rumors do. You and your witcher are finished in Temeria. Unless you catch the culprit.What does Henselt intend? TRISS: What\\'s Henselt up to?DETHMOLD: Are you out of your mind, Merigold?! Be glad I\\'m even talking to you.TRISS: I need to know what\\'s going on. Help me, Dethmold, and I\\'ll return the favor.DETHMOLD: You know nothing useful to me. And I don\\'t want your graces - you don\\'t tickle my fancy.[INTIMIDATION] We\\'ll meet in person one day...

A single question in exchange for information on Philippa.What do you know about the assassinations? TRISS: Do you know anything about the regicides? No lying.DETHMOLD: Oh, a mistake, Merigold. I really know nothing. All I can tell you is that it\\'s not of Henselt\\'s doing. I\\'ll let you know if I discover anything. Your turn.What\\'s Henselt up to? TRISS: What are Henselt\\'s political plans?DETHMOLD: Ha, you\\'re insolent, Merigold, but I gave you my word. Henselt wants to wrestle the Pontar Valley from Aedirn. And to force that weed Stennis to swear fealty.TRISS: Prince Stennis, Demavend\\'s heir?DETHMOLD: The same. Aedirn bereft of the Pontar Valley will become a principality dependant on Kaedwen. Your turn.What does Síle want in exchange for the cure? TRISS: What does Síle want? What\\'s her price for that miraculous cure?DETHMOLD: A seat on the royal council and the title to three alchemical shops which give above three hundred pounds in yearly revenue.TRISS: Well, well...DETHMOLD: If I had a say in this, I\\'d set the dogs on her. Your turn, Merigold.TRISS: Philippa\\'s in Vergen - a small town near the Kaedweni-Aedirnian border.DETHMOLD: I know its location very well. The remnants of Aedirn\\'s army have assembled there, led by a lass said to have killed a dragon.TRISS: Who\\'s the girl?DETHMOLD: She commands a rabble of peasants, poor noblemen and nonhumans. Even Prince Stennis, Demavend\\'s son, can\\'t disregard her. But that\\'s of no consequence. Henselt will trample those vermin, and chase them off with whips. What\\'s Philippa doing there?TRISS: Telling you won\\'t pay off, Dethmold. You know too little. Farewell.[The flashback ends.]DERAE: That\\'s all. I didn\\'t hear or see anything else.Have you ever spied on Síle? DERAE: I tried, but she always cast a spell and I couldn\\'t hear or see a thing.GERALT: Every time?DERAE: She forgot once.

Where ghosts of the fallen will fight a great battle. Save their souls and your memory will return...CEDRIC: Wha-What\\'s happening...? The forest... I feel a presence...GERALT: They come to bid you farewell.CEDRIC: My forest... Va fail, Gwynbleidd. Farewell.[Geralt closes Cedric\\'s eyes and bows his head. Not long after, Dandelion and Zoltan arrive.]DANDELION: Geralt! Where have you been!?GERALT: The kingslayer, dammit. I almost had him.ZOLTAN: He fled?GERALT: Teleported to Aedirn.DANDELION: What?! How?GERALT: He forced Triss to cast the spell.ZOLTAN: Shit!DANDELION: Roche sent me to find you - we\\'re setting off. He\\'s learned something new.ZOLTAN: The Scoia\\'tael are also up to something big.What does Roche intend to do? GERALT: What\\'s Roche planning?DANDELION: He went off on Loredo, so it must concern the commandant. It\\'s something important.What do the Scoia\\'tael want to do? [If Geralt knocked Iorveth out] GERALT: What do you know about the Scoia\\'tael, Zoltan?ZOLTAN: They want to free Iorveth and the other prisoners. Your help will be crucial.[If Geralt threw Iorveth his sword] GERALT: What are the Scoia\\'tael planning?ZOLTAN: They want to storm the barge and they need your help!GERALT: When did you join the Scoia\\'tael, Zoltan?ZOLTAN: It\\'s not like that. They\\'re taking the prisoners to Drakenborg. A special prison for nonhumans. Bloody monument to human hatred! The Scoia\\'tael don\\'t trust you, nor me for that matter. But you can change that.I guess I need to talk to them both. GERALT: I\\'ll talk to them. Maybe Roche or the Scoia\\'tael can finally be useful.  3.14 - At a Crossroads < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >  3.14.1 - Helped Iorveth in Cáelmewedd < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt checks in with Dandelion.]GERALT: Any idea what Roche might want?DANDELION: He mentioned something about Loredo, said it\\'s very important you speak. You should see him.[Geralt meets with Roche in the Blue Stripes\\' headquarters.]BLUE STRIPE: Vernon\\'s waiting inside.GERALT: Roche... Things have gotten a little more complicated...ROCHE: What the fuck were you doing with the Scoia\\'tael? You gave Iorveth a sword!GERALT: You followed me?ROCHE: I\\'ve got others who do that for me, Geralt. Ves, to be exact.You don\\'t trust me. GERALT: Iorveth and Letho had a falling out. I wanted to take advantage.ROCHE: Who\\'s Letho?GERALT: The kingslayer.ROCHE: Ah, you\\'re sworn friends now?GERALT: Stop pissing me off! I tried everything I could to get him! If you\\'d trusted me, we could\\'ve captured him by now.Iorveth can help us. GERALT: Iorveth knows a lot about the kingslayer, and they no longer see eye to eye. He could lead us to him.ROCHE: The only journey I\\'ll make with Iorveth in tow is to the scaffold in Vizima\\'s marketplace.GERALT: The kingslayer fled to Vergen in Aedirn. He forced Triss to teleport them both.ROCHE: Damn, he\\'s made a mockery of us! If that\\'s how he wants to play, I\\'ll make him regret it.What sparked the massacre? GERALT: Flotsam\\'s ablaze. How did it start?ROCHE: When Ves reported you\\'d met with Iorveth, I ordered Loredo to provide us with backup. The incompetent oafs were supposed to wait for a signal, but the crossbowmen were twitchy.ROCHE: We surprised them, but Iorveth... the Scoia\\'tael gave us hell. We barely escaped alive. Many of my men are wounded, but Loredo\\'s people... When news that elves massacred a dozen soldiers hit the trading post, two of the soldiers\\' fathers decided to take it out on an elven girl.ROCHE: You can imagine what happened next.Dandelion said you learned something new. GERALT: I heard you have news for me.ROCHE: Loredo has a deal with Kaedwen. That merchant living in his house is Henselt\\'s agent. For a pouch of gold the good commandant promised to support Kaedweni troops in the event of a conflict...GERALT: So, what now?ROCHE: I want that spy, to squeeze him for information. And I\\'ve sentenced Commandant Loredo to death.GERALT: Roche, we have to sail, we need to get to Aedirn.ROCHE: I\\'m not leaving until I deal with Loredo. The spy may know something about the kingslayers. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Henselt of Kaedwen was behind all this.All right, let\\'s do it your way. GERALT: All right, let\\'s deal with this spy.I need to do something. GERALT: I\\'ll be back later.ROCHE: Dammit Geralt, it\\'s not a date. You can\\'t keep putting it off![Agreeing leads to Death to the Traitor.][Geralt meets Zoltan and Iorveth in the elven ruins.]SCOIA\\'TAEL: Iorveth awaits you, dh\\'oine.ZOLTAN: Be sure to speak to Iorveth, Geralt.IORVETH: Where is he?GERALT: He forced Triss to teleport them both to Aedirn.IORVETH: No... The Scoia\\'tael in Aedirn will pay for my stupidity with their lives.IORVETH: Ele\\'yas, ready the unit to march. You\\'ll leave immediately.There was a massacre in town. GERALT: There was a massacre in Flotsam. The streets run red with your brethren\\'s blood.IORVETH: I know. That\\'s why I need your help.GERALT: You want me to murder humans at your side?IORVETH: I wish death upon every one of those dh\\'oine. But that\\'s not the point. Upper Aedirn is our goal.What\\'s so important in Upper Aedirn? GERALT: Why Upper Aedirn?IORVETH: The Pontar Valley is a juicy piece of meat beset by hounds.GERALT: The Scoia\\'tael bite hardest.IORVETH: It\\'s our land! Our forefathers\\' land. I\\'m no bandit, Gwynbleidd - I lead a great army.Looking to create an elven state? GERALT: It sounds like you want to establish an elven state.IORVETH: There is already an elven state - Dol Blathanna.GERALT: Francesca Findabair rules there.IORVETH: Rules? She merely carries out Nilfgaardian orders. We want a truly free state where an elf could visit a human inn! A land where humans could enter the forest without fear!You want to be king? GERALT: And you plan to be king? King Iorveth I?IORVETH: I\\'ve already told you, I know the head the crown would fit. We merely have to place it there.GERALT: Whose head is it?IORVETH: One who believes in integrity, honesty and honor. A person who won\\'t sell out to Nilfgaard for a few florins. A woman named Saskia.GERALT: Is she your fiancée?IORVETH: Don\\'t mock me, Gwynbleidd.GERALT: It sounds like she\\'s more important to you. Not just a woman whose head would fit the crown.IORVETH: You\\'ll understand once you meet her. Soon, the whole world will hear of the Virgin of Aedirn, a woman blessed with extraordinary courage.GERALT: Has she proven her courage, or is that just talk?IORVETH: She defeated a dragon.What do you know about Vergen? GERALT: You said you\\'re going to Vergen.IORVETH: True.GERALT: Why go to a dwarven town?IORVETH: Henselt and his army have pitched camp on the right riverbank. The Virgin and a sorceress gather reinforcements to defend Aedirn.GERALT: Which sorceress?IORVETH: Philippa Eilhart.GERALT: What\\'s a Redanian sorceress doing in Aedirn?IORVETH: Only she can reveal that.What\\'s your plan? GERALT: What does the leader of an army expect of me?IORVETH: That you accompany me to Aedirn. Perhaps you\\'ll find your sorceress there. You\\'ll certainly find someone who will soon change the balance of power in the North.That\\'s two days away on foot. GERALT: That\\'s two days\\' travel on foot. You\\'ll never make it in time.IORVETH: I have a plan.GERALT: What plan?IORVETH: First you must agree to help us.Count me in. GERALT: Count me in. We\\'ll get Letho together.IORVETH: Excellent. We\\'ve no time to lose. We need to capture the prison barge.GERALT: You want to enter a town where they\\'re massacring elves?GERALT: I take back what I said - you\\'re not grandiose, you\\'re mad.IORVETH: My mother claimed likewise.What\\'s it all about, Iorveth? GERALT: I need to know more before I decide.IORVETH: No, vatt\\'ghern. You helped me with Letho. That\\'s the sole reason we\\'re speaking. We may both be pursuing the same son of a bitch, but I haven\\'t forgotten the company you arrived in.IORVETH: Make your choice now. I\\'ll let you go if you refuse. I couldn\\'t do that later.I need to do something first. GERALT: I can help, but I need to take care of something first.IORVETH: Be quick.

They wish to watch me die, and I wish to watch them die. It\\'s the way of things in this world. The other side of the coin - a concept devised by philosophers in Oxenfurt who have never set foot in Flotsam or any place like it.GERALT: No one\\'s going to die today, Iorveth.

Ran out of the tower in flames and jumped in the river. We fished him out. Sooner or later, humans will kill off all the Aen Seidhe, all dwarves and gnomes.

Grabbing Geralt, I embarked on a voyage upriver, deeper into the Pontar Valley. If the elves could be believed, it was there that free folk from all around had assembled there, beneath Vergen\\'s banners, to resist the Kaedweni invader.\\xa0I should mention the exceptional individuals who made up my fellowship for this voyage. I usually get nervous around Scoia\\'tael. I see them as scoundrels and murderers, and find their presence outright unwanted. But I must admit I was glad to have the help of Iorveth and his infamous bunch, who could prove highly helpful... help, helpful... That\\'s not nice.\\xa0Highly useful, then.][Continued in Chapter II (Iorveth).]  3.16 - Death to the Traitor (Roche) < PREV CONTENTS[Geralt and the Blue Stripes gather around for Roche\\'s mission briefing.]ROCHE: Listen very carefully - I\\'m not repeating this. We have two targets. The first is a Kaedweni spy - Arnolt Malliger. I want him alive.ROCHE: The other is Bernard Loredo, the trading post\\'s commander and a traitor to Temeria. We don\\'t let his kind live.ROCHE: Arnolt almost never leaves the residence, so we need to strike there. To get inside, we\\'ll use Ves\\' unusual talents, and Bernard\\'s habits.GERALT: Stop calling him by his first name. It really rubs me the wrong way.ROCHE: Whatever you wish.ROCHE: Loredo\\'s house - the first floor contains guest quarters. Geralt had the opportunity to take a look. Regular patrols. Second floor... Loredo\\'s bodyguards\\' quarters. They think they\\'re the toughest warriors this side of the Yaruga, but really they\\'re lame drowners dressed in colorful gambesons.ROCHE: Third floor, the lion\\'s den. Here, Loredo stores plundered valuables. It\\'s where he sleeps, shits and wanks off while staring at the statuette of a she-elf. Only the following are allowed to enter: Arnolt Malliger, Loredo\\'s mother, his cousin and... whores.VES: Ha. I\\'m not sure I still have that frock...ROCHE: After making his round of the trading post, Loredo always orders two ladies. Ves will act as one of them. The house is a bloody fortress, but Loredo had it enlarged. The witcher will enter through the extension. Ves will open a window for you.ROCHE: Once in you\\'ll have to improvise, Geralt, but you\\'ll have the element of surprise. Ves can hold her own too.ROCHE: Zenin and Ryckard will provide cover from vantage points. If things get hot, lure those whoresons near the windows. I\\'ll be in the courtyard with the rest, ready to enter in the extreme. I repeat, in the extreme.ROCHE: That\\'s all. Any questions? No? Let\\'s get to work.[Geralt can get into the compound one of two ways; either through the nekker cave or over a wall using a ladder the Stripes have set up.][If Geralt goes through the cave] [Geralt climbs up the ladder at the end and drops down immediately into the storage compound where he found the kayran trap part. The sex worker Ves was partnered with is there alone.]GERALT: Where\\'s Ves?HELEN: So that\\'s her name. I knew she was no hooker. They\\'ve taken her to the tower.GERALT: Great, thanks.HELEN: Wait! The tower\\'s locked. The soldiers upstairs guard the keys.GERALT: Damn! I need to get in there.HELEN: Loredo\\'s mother also has keys.GERALT: Where is she?HELEN: In the basement, distilling fisstech.GERALT: Take care.HELEN: Kill the whoreson.[If Geralt goes over the ladder] [Geralt goes to meet the Stripes behind Loredo\\'s compound after dark.]BLUE STRIPE: Your chariot awaits, fair youth. The good spirits of this tower will guide and protect you. Heh-heh.[Geralt climbs the ladder and drops down on the other side into Loredo\\'s back lot. The merchant spy Roche wants is looking around with a torch.]ARNOLT: Where are you? Hiding? You like playing hide and seek? I\\'ll find you.ARNOLT: Naughty girl. Daddy will have to punish you...ARNOLT: Come on, precious - you love it when I mount you.ARNOLT: Ah, we\\'re playing hide and seek now? Wait till I find you, little sparrow!ARNOLT: You\\'re getting on my nerves, skeezer. Show yourself right now![Geralt knocks him out, then makes his way into the storage compound where he found the kayran trap part. The sex worker Ves was partnered with is there by herself.]HELEN: You\\'re this new girl\\'s friend?GERALT: Where is she?HELEN: The Commander took her to the tower. Hurry.GERALT: How did you know?HELEN: She was obviously not one of us - a hooker always knows a hooker. So I guessed something was gonna happen... Before they took her she whispered, \"Window in the extension.\" When that bastard went to take a pee, I noticed you climbing over the wall.GERALT: How do I get to Loredo?HELEN: When he\\'s having it off, he lets no one in. But his mother has keys.HELEN: You must really love her, taking such risks...GERALT: Ri-ight... Where\\'s the mother?HELEN: In the basement, distilling fisstech.GERALT: Thanks. Now go. Climb over the wall and run. If a tall man dressed in blue stops you, tell him everything. Tell him his plan was ingeniously simple.HELEN: Thank you. If you manage to enter the tower, kill the bastard, witcher. He should die slowly and painfully for all he did to us...[After talking to Helen, Geralt climbs a scaffolding and leaps through one of the windows of Loredo\\'s house. At the same time, a cutscene shows Loredo snorting fisstech in a different room with Ves strung up against the wall. Geralt sneaks through the halls and finds Marietta in her lab.]MARIETTA: Oooooh! Who the hell are you? What do you want?GERALT: The key to the upper quarters. I know you have it.MARIETTA: You want to free the elven girl? Your efforts are in vain. Like in Ithlinne\\'s prophecy - the seed has been planted and will soon sprout.GERALT: Shut up and give me the key.MARIETTA: Uh. The key, the key... Where did I put it...?[She throws fisstech in Geralt\\'s eyes and comes at him with a knife. He kills her. In the room above, Loredo gropes Ves. Geralt makes his way up to the tower where Loredo is. He can hear Loredo through the door.]VES: Stay away.LOREDO: You\\'re dressed like a whore - behave like one. First I\\'ll plough you, and then I\\'ll slice off your tits. Does that strike your fancy?VES: Cut off your own, whoreson.LOREDO: I love it when bitches bark.[Geralt enters the room.]MORIL: It\\'s a trap! Look out![Loredo lunges out with a halberd. Geralt dodges, then engages him.]LOREDO: Tougher to kill a soldier than a bandit, eh?GERALT: Yeah, you\\'re tougher than your mother was. But you\\'ll die just the same.LOREDO: What?!!! You bastard!LOREDO: Demavend should have killed all you freaks!VES: Kill the son of a bitch!VES: Make him die in pain!VES: What now, Loredo? Balls shriveling?[Geralt kills Loredo.]VES: Quick, untie me.VES: Geralt, we\\'ve no time to lose. She needs help. We need to get her out of here.[Geralt unties Ves.]VES: Thanks, Geralt. I heard something behind that door.[In the next room, an elf woman is lying on a bed, arms wrapped around her stomach.]MORIL: Don\\'t leave me here, please...VES: You don\\'t look like a whore, elf.MORIL: My name is Moril... what month is it?VES: This is no time to chat. Can you walk?MORIL: I\\'ll not stay here any longer, even if I must crawl out.VES: She won\\'t make it through the garden, Geralt. We must leave by the front. Lead the way - we\\'ll be right behind you.MORIL: S-so what month is it?VES: Lammas.MORIL: Autumn\\'s begun? When they kidnapped me... it was snowing.VES: And the child\\'s father is...?MORIL: This child has only a mother. When I realized I was pregnant... I wanted to kill myself.VES: Don\\'t say that...MORIL: I am Aen Seidhe.[Geralt goes first as Ves helps Moril down the stairs. Halfway down, Moril stops.]MORIL: I... I can\\'t make it. I think I...VES: Damn, her water broke. Geralt, change of plans!GERALT: But...VES: Back to the tower. I need a clean bed, hot water and some time. We can\\'t be disturbed... Go get help.[Geralt heads down to clear the way of guards and joins the fight in the courtyard. As the last of Loredo\\'s men fall, Roche arrives.]ROCHE: Geralt! I see we\\'re in time.GERALT: Where have you been, Roche?ROCHE: A little problem along the way.[Flashback to Iorveth and Roche\\'s confrontation in the forest. The two circle each other, then engage in single combat.][If Iorveth wins] IORVETH: The Temerian Special Forces, created by Foltest to combat the Scoia\\'tael after the first war with Nilfgaard. Veterans, professionals, the best of the best. This is the end, Roche. See these emblems? Temerian lilies - that\\'s all I lacked. I\\'ve defeated the commanders of all the special forces in the North. Now, I shall unite the Scoia\\'tael...ROCHE: Finish what you started...IORVETH: I shan\\'t kill you, Roche. We Aen Seidhe never kill the last specimens of dying breeds. Live on and remember who defeated you, remember he can do so again. Va fail, Vernon Roche.ROCHE: You\\'re making a mistake, Iorveth. I will find you.[If Roche wins] IORVETH: Defeated by a dh\\'oine. I must be getting old... What now?ROCHE: Consider yourself lucky. Though you deserve torture, I lack the means, so I\\'ll simply lop off your head. You\\'ll die a warrior\\'s death.IORVETH: I don\\'t regret a thing.ROCHE: Impending death has addled your mind.IORVETH: I don\\'t regret that it\\'s you. After so many years, it would be stupid to die from an accidental bolt in the eye or, worse yet, influenza...ROCHE: Damn. Lucky again - your archers approach. I defeated you once, Iorveth, and I can do it again. Remember that.IORVETH: We shall see about that, friend. We shall see...ROCHE: The whoreson ran away, but I\\'m sure he\\'ll show up again.BLUE STRIPE: Bloody nonhumans.ROCHE: Enough of Iorveth. What\\'s with Loredo and where\\'s Ves?GERALT: Loredo\\'s dead. I saved Ves, barely.ROCHE: What happened?GERALT: Your plan was hardly the most...[Ves interrupts them by running out onto the balcony, holding a baby.]VES: A boy, Geralt. A healthy boy.ROCHE: What the...? Whose child is that?GERALT: Moril\\'s.ROCHE: Whose?GERALT: We found an elf woman Loredo kidnapped almost a year ago. He was the father.BLUE STRIPE: [spits] I\\'d never touch a she-elf.[Geralt hits the man.]ROCHE: Enough! We don\\'t have time for that! The ship\\'s waiting.[They hear a cry and run up after Ves, who is crouched over Moril\\'s body, cradling the elf\\'s slit wrists.]VES: Why did you do it? Why?[A commando attempts to lay a hand on Ves to comfort her.]VES: Don\\'t touch me!BLUE STRIPE: I hate this town.ROCHE: Prepare the boat. We sail immediately.BLUE STRIPE: What about the kid?ROCHE: It\\'s not coming with us. And who in this hellhole will take in a half-breed?GERALT: Seherim. Take it to Seherim in Lobinden. And make sure to tell him it\\'s Moril\\'s child.[Over the railing of Roche\\'s departing boat, Geralt and Roche wave to Seherim, who has Moril\\'s child cradled in his arms.[DANDELION, NARRATING: The assassin had had his day, very true. He\\'d kidnapped Triss Merigold. It seemed like Foltest\\'s life had not been enough. It seemed like the killer also wanted the monarch\\'s former advisor.\\xa0There was no time to think, it was time to act. Grabbing Geralt, I embarked on a voyage upriver, deeper into the Pontar Valley. There, in a region known as Lormark, King Henselt of Kaedwen had made camp with his army. \\'King\\' is the key word here - denoting the central figure in my plan to capture the kingslayer.\\xa0The special forces of King May-the-Soil-Lie-Lightly-Upon-Him-Foltest had lost some of their customary enthusiasm, treating us to not one single joke of the \\'how many ways can you skin an elf\\' variety. Which only geos to support my theory that the human mind is capable of producing a finite amount of horror before some manner of reflection springs itself upon it.][Continued in Chapter II (Roche).]Back to topDocument © Laurelnose.

Two days after leaving Flotsam.][The camera zooms out to reveal Saskia, the monk Olcan, Prince Stennis, and a convoy of dwarves.]SASKIA: Three thousand men – burned to ashes in minutes.STENNIS: I remember the stillness when the news reached Vengerberg. The palace, the streets, the houses. The entire capital cloaked in silence.SASKIA: The cries were here, every last man. I was somewhere beyond that hill... In the middle of the massacre.STENNIS: What is your intention, Saskia?SASKIA: I intend to stop Aedirn from being sold.STENNIS: We cannot afford a war with Henselt. We must parley...SASKIA: Leave issues of war to me, Prince. Concentrate on King Henselt. Yarpen Zigrin claims he\\'s short-tempered. Provoke him to strike and we\\'ll negotiate once the battle\\'s won.STENNIS: I still cannot fathom why the nobles betrayed us...SASKIA: Spit on the nobles, Prince. They\\'ve meant nothing since the day my peasant force scattered them on the Dyphne.OLCAN: By the good deity Kreve, m\\'Lord! The girl is a demon incarnate!STENNIS: Firstly, the girl has a name. Secondly, she\\'s the best commander I have – all others have betrayed me.OLCAN: But she\\'s a monster! Kreve spoke to me in a dream! I saw a snake-like she-demon devour your heritage!STENNIS: Silence, Olcan. We near the meeting place.[The group makes their way through the ravines towards where the meeting is taking place. They pass groups of Kaedweni soldiers on the way.]SOLDIER 1: Is that her?!SOLDIER 2: I thought she\\'d be taller.SOLDIER 3: Don\\'t look like no virgin to me.SOLDIER 1: The Aedirnian rebel!SOLDIER 2: She looks right battle hardened, she does!SOLDIER 3: Who\\'s the one in the plate armor?SOLDIER 1: The dragonslayer!SOLDIER 2: She invited?SOLDIER 3: No.SOLDIER 2: This\\'ll be interesting.[Saskia\\'s party approaches the meeting tent where the Aedirnian nobles are negotiating with Henselt.]FELART: We shall sign everything, Your Majesty, as you...HENSELT: We have guests...HENSELT: Welcome, Stennis, son of Demavend. I invite you to join us.STENNIS: Greetings, Henselt. You seem at home in Aedirn. You are here, yet I do not recall inviting you.HENSELT: Felart did so in your stead. I\\'m here at his behest. I\\'ve broken no truces or treaties – yet.STENNIS: Oh, is that so? Mister Broghan, please escort Count Felart to a secluded spot and remove his troublesome head.FELART: Don\\'t you dare, boy. You\\'re no king! Your father...STENNIS: My father is dead. The folk still mourn him, while you betray his good name and his country!FELART: Your Majesty, I must request your protection. This young man has lost his mind!STENNIS: Take him away.FELART: Your Majesty! What of our agreement?!HENSELT: I need you no longer, Felart, now Stennis is here.[Two dwarves escort Felart away.]STENNIS: Anyone else wish to object? Wonderful! To the matter at hand, then.HENSELT: Well said. I will show you my hand. I\\'ve over 200 armed men encamped nearby - enough to hold the ford for several hours. Another 5000 battle-hungry lads await on the other bank. What say you to that?Greater forces have crumbled beneath Vergen\\'s walls. STENNIS: They\\'ll be 5000 dead lads should you move against Vergen.HENSELT: Take time to consider, boy... These are border marches, a mere piece of land. Relinquish it to me and you\\'ll keep your crown. Oppose me and I shall crush you without mercy. Give me Lormark and return to Vengerberg.This is Upper Aedirn. STENNIS: Do you know why there are no marquises in Aedirn? We\\'ve no marches to speak of, let alone to share. This is Upper Aedirn. My fatherland, my subjects.HENSELT: A wolf pup should think twice before growling like a bear.[Continues from \"STENNIS: I\\'ll not be intimidated, Henselt.\"]This is the richest piece of land in the north. STENNIS: This \"piece of land\" generates more revenue annually than all the forests of the great Kaedwen combined. Upper Aedirn is an ever-lasting pot of gold. Should I simply relinquish it? Or do you plan to make a purchase? Will you pay me with berries? Animal pelts? Will you send your armies into Kaedwen\\'s woods to gather mushrooms?HENSELT: You\\'re right. Better I send them to steal your pot of gold.STENNIS: I\\'ll not be intimidated, Henselt.HENSELT: Perhaps... Is it possible you merely play the courageous cockerel, yet deep inside fear eats at your heart? Is one push enough to send you over the edge? Or must I push twice?STENNIS: Try me!HENSELT: I tire of this discussion. I have the upper hand and no amount of scintillating talk will change that. We both know I\\'ll not leave empty handed. What do you propose?Withdraw your army and you\\'ll save them from being massacred. STENNIS: Withdraw your forces across the Pontar and for all time relinquish any claims to Upper Aedirn...HENSELT: Whoa, hold there! I don\\'t believe you understood my query. What will I get out of it?STENNIS: Peace.HENSELT: You mock me? You think this is a game? You just talked yourself into a war, ya little shit.STENNIS: Don\\'t threaten me! We came here to speak...HENSELT: Enough of your prattle - draw your sword!STENNIS: Saskia.SASKIA: I\\'m ready. Care to dance, Your Majesty?[A fight breaks out between the two sides.]I\\'ll reimburse you for your military escapade. STENNIS: I shall reimburse the costs of this foray and add enough to restore the luster to your palace at Ard Carraigh. I\\'m certain our advisors can resolve the details.HENSELT: That will take a great deal of gold...STENNIS: Peace is priceless.HENSELT: You want peace? Fight for it.STENNIS: I\\'m not sure I understand.HENSELT: You speak like a ruler, but words will only get you so far. You carry a sword, wear armor and talk like a warrior. Now prove you are one.HENSELT: I challenge you to a duel. Here and now, before these folk and the gods. Upper Aedirn shall belong to the victor.I accept your challenge. HENSELT: Ready?STENNIS: Begin when you will, King.HENSELT: Blood and honor!!![Henselt and Stennis meet in single combat.]I\\'m not prepared to fight. STENNIS: An old wound ails me still... I\\'m ill-prepared to fight.HENSELT: You disappoint me.SASKIA: I\\'m ready. Fight me, King. The same conditions apply.HENSELT: \\'Twould be a shame to cut up such a pretty face. As none here are worthy, we shall resolve the problems of Lormark, the Aedirnian crown and the rebellion in one fell swoop.HENSELT: Grab them![The Kaedwenis attack.]You can have the Dragonslayer. STENNIS: I shall give you Saskia the Dragonslayer.SASKIA: What are you playing at, Prince?STENNIS: Silence, Saskia. I\\'m about to spare the country a tragedy.HENSELT: What would you have me do with her?STENNIS: Your eyes\\'ve not strayed from her once since we arrived.HENSELT: Aye... There\\'s some spark in the lass.SASKIA: I\\'ll not allow it! This land is under my protection. If no one else has the courage to stand up to you, I will. Listen well, King. You have one hour to quit Upper Aedirn with your forces. If you fail to do so, it\\'s war.SASKIA: If but one Kaedweni soldier remains on this land one minute past the deadline, it\\'s war.SASKIA: You will instruct your heralds to proclaim around and about that you apologize to the people of Aedirn for this shameful incursion. Otherwise, it\\'s war.HENSELT: Ha–ha–ha! You\\'ve got balls, woman. My soldiers would call me a coward or a madman. I am Henselt of Ard Carraigh – I\\'ll not run from a woman, even a dragonslayer. That apart, you\\'re a pretty fetching lass...HENSELT: I want this land, I want its gold, and I want you, Dragonslayer!HENSELT: Grab them!!![A fight breaks out between the two sides.]I am forced to accept your terms. STENNIS: The crown and a non-aggression pact in exchange for Upper Aedirn... Are you ready to sign such a treaty?HENSELT: At once. Make your decision. Are you from a family of rulers or cowards?SASKIA: Prince, you\\'re making a mistake...STENNIS: Stay out of this, Saskia!HENSELT: Well, well – she has a voice. Saskia the Dragonslayer. You\\'re much prettier than they claim...HENSELT: You\\'ll need to throw in the lass, too. Peasants should work the fields, not rebel and burn down the estates of their masters. It\\'s to your advantage to give her up.[Continues from \"SASKIA: I\\'ll not allow it!\"]You\\'ll break all the treaties. STENNIS: In attacking Aedirn, you would break the provisions of the Peace of Cintra. All the Northern Kingdoms will be obliged to support me.HENSELT: None will stand with you.STENNIS: Radovid of Redania, the dukes of the South...HENSELT: You dream, boy. They\\'re not to be counted on. And the treaty? I piss on it as do they. You are alone.SASKIA: Not entirely.STENNIS: Stay out of this, Saskia.[Continues from \"HENSELT: Well, well - she has a voice.\"][If Henselt agreed to single combat] KNIGHT: Opposing one another in a chivalrous duel shall be Henselt of Ard Carraigh, King of Kaedwen, Sovereign of Caingorn and Malleore, last of the line of the Unicorn...KNIGHT: ...and Prince Stennis, son of King Demavend III of Aedirn, lawful heir to the Aedirnian throne! Gentlemen, begin!HENSELT: Draw your sword![Whether in single combat or as an all-out clash, Henselt defeats Stennis. The priest approaches to try and intervene.]OLCAN: Stop! Stop in the name of Kreve, Freya and Melitele![Henselt slaughters the priest on the obelisk overlooking the area. It begins to glow with an unearthly blue light. Meanwhile, Geralt, Dandelion, Zoltan approach a band of arguing dwarves.]YARPEN: By the milk of Mother Creatrix\\'s tits! Geralt of Rivia!!! And in the best company, to boot...DANDELION: Yarpen Zigrin!ZOLTAN: It\\'s been years, you old prick! It\\'s great to see you in good health.YARPEN: Geralt – starin\\' as if you\\'ve seen a ghost! Muster up a hug for an old friend![Unlike Dandelion and Zoltan, Geralt does not embrace Yarpen.]ZOLTAN: Geralt\\'s head\\'s not exactly on straight...YARPEN: Hah! Meaning he truly did in Foltest?! Fine by me. Foltest was a ploughing niggard and a niggardly plougher. You did right, Geralt.DANDELION: Not the point. Geralt\\'s lost his memory.GERALT: And I didn\\'t kill Foltest.YARPEN: Right, right - what\\'s the difference? Someone did. But we\\'ve bigger problems now.[Iorveth arrives with his elves.]IORVETH: Where\\'s Saskia?YARPEN: Oh, aye. Why\\'s this butcher here?IORVETH: I\\'ve come with a hundred archers - the best in the world. We\\'re here to aid your cause.YARPEN: Well, you\\'ll need to wait. Saskia and Prince Penis – ptooey – rather, Stennis, went off to parley with Henselt. Me and the boys are waitin\\', in case something goes wrong...[The obelisk\\'s unearthly glow becomes visible.]YARPEN: The sun\\'s gone dark... Call the sorceress!IORVETH: Come, Geralt.GERALT: Stay here.[Back at the obelisk, Saskia rushes to pull Stennis up. Dethmold and Sheala create a portal and whisk Henselt away. Geralt and Iorveth arrive to Saskia\\'s side - she looks past them, and they turn to see undead soldiers dragging themselves out of the earth.]IORVETH: Saskia! Get Saskia! She must not die![Geralt, Iorveth, Saskia, and the dwarves clash with the wraiths. After a period of fighting, an owl flies overhead, and a bolt of golden light clears the field of wraiths. Saskia runs back to Stennis\\' side and hauls him up.]IORVETH: An owl!SASKIA: Philippa! She\\'ll show us the way!GERALT: Iorveth, you\\'ve got some explaining to do...[Philippa casts a dome of golden light over them and they begin to descend down the hill.]IORVETH: By Aelirenn\\'s blood! Wraiths!GERALT: Silver harms them. I\\'ll cover you.STENNIS: My deef! Hep me!IORVETH: Shut up, dh\\'oine.[As they continue, it becomes clear the wraiths are dead Aedirnian and Kaedweni soldiers, fighting each other in a vast battlefield. With Saskia supporting Stennis, Iorveth and Geralt take care of the wraiths that get through Philippa\\'s shield.]GERALT: The fog\\'s thinning. Not far now.[They finally emerge from the battlefield, where Yarpen meets them. The owl lands on his shoulder, then transforms into a woman.]PHILIPPA: I hate flying through fog...PHILIPPA: Saskia, are you all right?SASKIA: It\\'s just a flesh wound. You and the witcher – we owe you our lives.PHILIPPA: I am here to protect you... And you, witcher?GERALT: I\\'m after a kingslayer who kidnapped Triss Merigold.PHILIPPA: And brought her here?GERALT: Is this an interrogation?PHILIPPA: There are warrants on your head in Temeria, Kaedwen and Redania. And I\\'m responsible for Saskia\\'s safety...SASKIA: That\\'s enough, Philippa. You told me yourself you thought him innocent.YARPEN: Saskia, folk are riled... First the sun went out, then the Squirrels arrived, now this fog... It\\'s too much for the common folk.SASKIA: True. Summon all the commanders to the meeting hall. Iorveth, give me some time. I must prepare them for your arrival. Witcher, Philippa - you must be there, too. I wish to hear what we can expect from this anomaly and how we might be rid of it.SASKIA: Worry not, Yarpen. The legendary White Wolf and the equally famous Philippa Eilhart should have a remedy for several hundred rabid wraiths.[Back in Vergen, they meet up with the alderman.]SASKIA: I want to see all commanders in the council chamber. Philippa, that includes you and the witcher.SASKIA: Cecil, the gates are to remain shut until we\\'re done. You\\'ll answer with your beard if they open for any reason.[Saskia heads into the Castle of the Three Fathers, where the war council is set to take place, leaving Geralt with Cecil and Cecil\\'s nephew Skalen Burdon.]CECIL: Welcome to Vergen, witcher. I\\'m Cecil Burdon, the alderman.GERALT: Geralt of Rivia.CECIL: We\\'ve got a spare room at the inn... It\\'s not much, but at least you\\'ll have a roof over your head and a solid bed \\'neath your arse.GERALT: Thanks, I could use that.CECIL: Skalen, show master Geralt to his quarters, and visit Reverend Olcan\\'s chambers on your way back to inform everyone that uh... he has departed.SKALEN: That is, that he died a hero, slain by the invaders...CECIL: Exactly. You see, master witcher? He\\'s young but clever. We\\'ll make a real dwarf out of him yet![Skalen shows Geralt to his quarters.]SKALEN: This shall be your chamber, witcher. They say Seltkirk of Gulet himself slept in this bed before battle... Didn\\'t bring him any luck, but at least he was well rested before he died. Need anything else?GERALT: Thanks, Skalen.[Geralt heads to the war council. Around the circular table are Saskia, Philippa, Yarpen, Zoltan, Cecil Burden, Stennis, a human peasant named Kalten, and a handful of human nobles.]SASKIA: You missed quite a scrap, gentlemen. And an opportunity to slay a monarch.[If Henselt agreed to single combat] SASKIA: The prince dueled Henselt. They fought as equals...KALTEN: Impossible!SASKIA: And yet it was so.[If a battle was fought] SASKIA: There was a struggle and the prince was wounded...PHILIPPA: You\\'ve all seen the magical phenomenon covering the battlefield. For any who still have doubts, this is no mundane mist, nor a petty fairground illusion. Most likely we are up against a blood curse, an old and powerful spell.PHILIPPA: We do not know who cast it or why. For now I have one piece of good news and several pieces of bad news. The good news is that Henselt and his army have been halted for the time being.KALTEN: And the bad news?PHILIPPA: The mist will grow – it may even engulf Vergen. Furthermore, wraiths may emerge from it.YARPEN: Can they be made penitent? With an axe to the head?GERALT: In theory, yes, but I would suggest putting your faith in a silver weapon. Furthermore, the ghosts will weaken as they move away from the mist.YARPEN: Is there any way to drive it off? Exor-i-cise it?PHILIPPA: A question for myself and Geralt of Rivia...KALTEN: The kingslayer?PHILIPPA: Contrary to what old women at the wells say, he did not, in fact, slay any kings.YARPEN: Course he didn\\'t. Wouldn\\'t hurt a fly, that one. Look in his eyes - you\\'ll see he\\'s the sensitive kind.PHILIPPA: Whatever you may see in his eyes, few know more about lifting curses. Gentlemen, I do not require you to understand this phenomenon, but there are a few rules I insist you must follow...ZOLTAN: Here we go.PHILIPPA: No one is to approach the mist. It is mortally dangerous. In addition, we need to learn the story of the battle. For this I especially count on the aid of Mr. Cecil Burdon.CECIL: At your service, m\\'Lady.PHILIPPA: Thank you. To lift the curse, we require some objects symbolic of the war. Ones belonging to those who perished here three years past.YARPEN: Pfff! More scrap iron from that massacre lying about than lice in Cecil\\'s beard. I thought curses were best handled with...PHILIPPA: Please leave the thinking to me, Mister Zigrin. And I\\'d gladly hear less from you from now on. The objects must be magically active and strictly linked to the ghosts of the fallen. That is all.SASKIA: Let me be clear - you\\'re all to aid Philippa and the witcher. What are you grumbling about now, Yarpen?YARPEN: Ah-hrgh... Somethin\\' in my gullet..SASKIA: Take a swig of wine. Now, to worldly matters. How many are we?YARPEN: Saskia, you know well...SASKIA: How many?YARPEN: We dwarves are near two hundred. But don\\'t judge us by our number.KALTEN: A half-thousand peasants will come, though you\\'ll get no precise count.SASKIA: Milords?NOBLE 1: Fifty-three knights and another two hundred armed men. Not enough...SASKIA: Henselt leads five thousand. Five to one against us. What think you of that?NOBLE 1: We are few, they are many... But we have our walls, low though they be... If we had archers, who knows...YARPEN: Oh, for a regiment of heavy arbalists from Lyria...SASKIA: We have something better. Iorveth\\'s elves. Scoia\\'tael.[Iorveth enters the council room and comes to stand at Saskia\\'s right hand, arms folded. Everyone at the table stands up, alarmed.]SASKIA: Gentlemen, I give you Iorveth.KALTEN: What do you seek here, murderer?!IORVETH: A hundred of the North\\'s best archers await your orders, Dragonslayer.ZOLTAN: You wished for archers - here they are.YARPEN: I take no pleasure in fraternizing with elves, but even a shit-coated stick can be a weapon.NOBLE 2: He burned down the villages of many in my hoard.STENNIS: The free peasantry is one thing, but a criminal with a price on his head in all the northern realms...? This is too much.IORVETH: Saskia, say the word and we\\'ll depart.SASKIA: Hear me out. Iorveth came to fight for me. I trust him and I know that he\\'ll stay the course. Just like each of you.KALTEN: How could you know that? He\\'s an elf! Treason runs in his veins...NOBLE 1: He\\'s been fighting humans for a century!SASKIA: But for the first time in scores of years his fight makes sense. The Scoia\\'tael know no peace, they\\'ve died for Nilfgaard, for the Valley of the Flowers – in vain. They\\'ve been betrayed and cheated. Now they have a new goal. The Pontar Valley could be the first state where no man would have to fear elven arrows when venturing beyond city walls, and elves and dwarves wouldn\\'t live in ghettos or on reservations.SASKIA: First, however, we have a battle to win. You know who we\\'re up against. It\\'s a splendid army, brave and well led. They cannot be scared off or routed. They have to be killed. I want Iorveth to sit at the same table as we do. I want him to kill Kaedweni for us. And I assure you that he\\'ll do so with a smile, if only you let him.YARPEN: If I\\'m to see a smile on that skinny face... I\\'m in. Iorveth stays.KALTEN: Bloody hell! Father\\'s turning in his grave, but a must\\'s a must. I say aye.STENNIS: Nay.NOBLE 3: You killed my men, elf. Remember them?IORVETH: If I hadn\\'t killed them, they\\'d have killed me.NOBLE 3: All right, for the sake of better times and for Kaedwen\\'s doom! Aye!ZOLTAN: Down with the sons of bitches! Cheers![Saskia lifts her cup in toast, as do the other mebers of the council. She takes a sip, sets her cup down. It glows a poisonous green. Saskia collapses, and both Iorveth and Philippa rush to her side.]PHILIPPA: Poison! She\\'s dying...PHILIPPA: Take her somewhere safe and guard her with your lives. I\\'ll gather what I need and join you soon.IORVETH: I\\'ll place my best warriors on watch.YARPEN: Quickly, lads! A litter![Iorveth and Geralt wait outside Philippa\\'s quarters. Cecil waits with them, pacing.]IORVETH: She\\'s ceased casting spells.CECIL: Went hoarse at the end there.[Philippa emerges.]GERALT: Saskia. Is she alive?PHILIPPA: In a manner of speaking. I\\'ve slowed her life functions as far as possible. Her condition is stable.What was the poison? IORVETH: Do you know the poison?PHILIPPA: Thaumador. Commonly known as magepain. It has a terrible reputation...IORVETH: An antidote must exist.Can you heal her? GERALT: What can we do?PHILIPPA: Treatment will require herbs, magic... and blood.GERALT: Not ordinary blood, I presume.PHILIPPA: Correct. We require royal blood.IORVETH: We could use Letho right now.Why do you need blood? GERALT: The nearest king is on the other side of the mist of wraiths.PHILIPPA: You misunderstood me. It need not be the blood of a ruling monarch. It is the genotype contained in royal blood that is required. Kings issue from ancient dynasties. Over the ages, to survive, rulers needed exceptional resistance and strength. As royal dynasties rarely admit common blood, the strength of their genes remains great.PHILIPPA: I shall employ self-healing, genetic therapy that will \"teach\" Saskia\\'s body how to rid itself of the poison.IORVETH: You\\'ll have her drink human blood?PHILIPPA: No, I shall inject it directly into her heart.What herbs do you need? GERALT: What kind of herbs are we talking about?PHILIPPA: I\\'ll need a subterranean variety of purple foxglove - known to the dwarves as the immortelle. And an elven rose of remembrance.Triss has a rose of remembrance... GERALT: Hmm... Triss had a rose of remembrance. She claimed the flowers are exceptional.PHILIPPA: Long ago, the Aen Seidhe who succeeded in cultivating the roses enjoyed great respect.IORVETH: Times have changed...PHILIPPA: As have elves...IORVETH: There are no elven gardens nearby. We must return to Flotsam.GERALT: Triss has a rose of remembrance from Flotsam. It\\'s her we need to find.Where do I look for immortelles? GERALT: Where will we find immortelles?PHILIPPA: They grow deep beneath the earth, which should not be a problem as Vergen lies on top of a mine.IORVETH: How will they help Saskia?PHILIPPA: Magepain wreaks havoc in internal tissues. The immortelle will help restore them.What else do you need? GERALT: What else do you need to heal Saskia?PHILIPPA: Thaumador is a self-perpetuating substance. Any incursion into a cluster of poisoned cells causes an immediate chain reaction. Each tainted cell that is removed is replaced by ten new tainted cells.PHILIPPA: To interrupt this reaction, I\\'ll need an ungodly amount of the Power. A water or air genie or one of the twenty legendary Rings of Power would be best...IORVETH: One to bring them all and in the darkness bind them...GERALT: Right, and then I\\'ll have to run bare-footed to the top of a volcano.PHILIPPA: All right, all right... Let\\'s forget the rings. I need a vast quantity of the Power, no matter the source. Find something.GERALT: An immortelle, a rose of remembrance, royal blood and magic. Sounds like a fairytale.IORVETH: A poor one at that. No prince\\'s kiss to top things off.PHILIPPA: I wish it were a fairytale, especially a poor one, as a happy ending would then be inevitable. May I count on your help, Geralt?GERALT: You may. What about the battle of wraiths?PHILIPPA: I must first see if the spells keeping Saskia alive are in order. Then we\\'ll consider how best to send the specters to their rest. Actually you could tend to that yourself... Ask the locals about the battle, maybe you\\'ll learn something.IORVETH: In that case, I shall search for the poisoner.[As Geralt leaves Philippa\\'s doorstep, outside the gates to Rhundurin Square, Cecil is making an announcement.]CECIL: People of Vergen! We have a magical mist full of ghosts just outside our walls, so ye\\'d better think twice before entering it!CECIL: The mist, may the plague take it, threatens all manner of creatures, so anyone headed to the quarries or walking through the gullies should take exceptional heed!CECIL: The Squirrels that have made camp by the burnt huts are not our enemies – so says Saskia and so it is!CECIL: Master Geralt of Rivia and sorceress Philippa Eilhart will deal with the mist and the wraiths! And now open the gates and get to work![Geralt goes to knock on Philippa\\'s door, but pauses when he hears moaning from inside. He opens the door anyways to find Philippa sitting on her bed, receiving a shoulder massage from a woman.]PHILIPPA: What is it, witcher?GERALT: Who was that girl?PHILIPPA: Cynthia. A leashed sorceress.GERALT: A charming expression. Do you also use muzzles?PHILIPPA: \"Leash\" means a connection between a sorceress and her assistant. An unfortunate term, I admit, but it explains how things are. Cynthia can tap my power, use my spells - she\\'s a conduit. And she\\'s learning along the way.PHILIPPA: It\\'s convenient and, except for the name, not derisive at all. But you\\'re not here to talk about Cynthia.Magic artifact - you said I needed to find one. GERALT: You said we\\'d need a magical object to cure Saskia. Any ideas where I might start looking?PHILIPPA: Magical items do not grow on trees, as you know. Luckily, this area has a long history. There\\'s the battle of wraiths, the site of Sabrina Glevissig\\'s death and suffering, the abandoned mines...GERALT: I was hoping you\\'d be specific.PHILIPPA: I won\\'t ask you to traipse around with a divining rod. But please try to be a little inventive. Ask the locals - that\\'s always a good place to start. I daresay Alderman Burdon knows every last stone in the area. Maybe you should see him?[Geralt goes to talk to the locals: Skalen, the innkeeper, and Cecil.]GERALT: I\\'m looking for places near Vergen where magic would be strong. Somewhere a sorcerer might have stayed?SKALEN: Lemme think. Verfran, a summoner of elementals, once lived in the wood beyond Vergen. They say his creatures excavated the entire southern wall. You could also search the nearby ruins and abandoned crypts. If boulders with arms and legs aren\\'t magic, then I don\\'t know what is.GERALT: I\\'m looking for places steeped in magic. You remember any stories of sorcerers or magical places in the area?INNKEEPER: Not counting the fire-spitting bitch from three years ago? Well, a sorcerer once lived in the wood beyond Vergen. You could look there, maybe something\\'s left. You might also speak to Cecil – nobody knows Vergen\\'s history as well as our alderman.GERALT: Saskia needs help, Cecil. Philippa can produce an antidote, but she needs a magic artifact to do that.CECIL: Would she like a fern and a dancing worm to go with it? Listen, I don\\'t know about magic, but there is a place... As long as I can remember, it\\'s been of interest to sorcerers. They say it\\'s a very strong Intersection. Look for magic there.GERALT: Where exactly is \"there\"?CECIL: Seek out the ruins in the forest beyond Vergen. There\\'s a Place of Power there, you can\\'t miss it. Why so glum? Saskia\\'s a tough girl, she\\'ll bounce back. Keep your head up.GERALT: Thanks, Cecil.CECIL: No, witcher, I thank you. Save that lass and you\\'ll save my town.[As Geralt leaves Vergen to investigate Cecil\\'s ruin, he overhears some dwarves talking.]DWARF 1: Let\\'s go drink, friends! I\\'m goin\\' to get as drunk as a lord!DWARF 2: Why\\'s that?DWARF 1: They stole it! The ploughing birds stole it! My dream is gone!DWARF 3: Then what\\'s the grin for?DWARF 1: Night after night I dreamed of my dead wife. For years! Let\\'s go for some liquor! Drinks on me![Geralt comes to the water north of Vergen, where he\\'s met by a party of Scoia\\'tael.]DWARF: Ah, you\\'ve finally given in, started killing humans, eh witcher?GERALT: Started that a while ago, actually. It just wasn\\'t something society was willing to acknowledge.DWARF: Foltest\\'s death - society acknowledged that. You know there\\'s a price on your head?GERALT: Yeah, I know. Too low for the risks involved, though.DWARF: It\\'s a bundle to us, witcher. We have to pay for everything - weapons, food, information...GERALT: Iorveth send you?DWARF: Iorveth will never learn of this.[Geralt kills the rogue Scoia\\'tael, and heads further north towards the tower Cecil mentioned. At the tower, inside a harpy nest, he finds a magical crystal, which he brings back to Philippa.]GERALT: I found one of the ingredients for Saskia\\'s cure.PHILIPPA: Show me.PHILIPPA: Interesting. Getting warmer, but still not there. It\\'s as if I\\'d sent you to get me the sun and you\\'d brought me a candle. We need something massive, an item of real power, Geralt. This is a dwarf\\'s dream. Stolen and magically encased in this crystal. It would do if it were stronger.GERALT: You know what this means? In addition to normal harpies, there are celaeno in the area.PHILIPPA: Celaeno?GERALT: Dream snatchers... The only harpy species to develop something resembling intelligence. They magically bind dreams to mountain crystals. I heard they once inhabited this area. Celaeno live among regular harpies, but their lair should be full of stolen dreams. One of those would be powerful enough, I\\'m sure.PHILIPPA: You\\'d have to enter the harpy lair through the quarry. Unfortunately, the gate to the caves is locked and Cecil Burdon won\\'t open it. I asked him on another occasion. Stubborn as a mule, that one. But we must not relent. Saskia clings to life by a thread. Let me show you the desire contained in this particular dream. Don\\'t be hasty to judge.GERALT: Hmm. Yes, I can feel it... Whose dream is it?PHILIPPA: Cecil Burdon\\'s.GERALT: In that case I need to see the alderman. Got a feeling he just might open the gate for me.[Geralt goes to Cecil.]GERALT: I need to get inside the harpy lair.CECIL: No chance.GERALT: I know all about the harpies. They steal dreams, collect them. I found one, but it proved too weak for our purposes. I need a stronger one. So I\\'m asking you nicely, open the damn gate.CECIL: Listen, witcher. I want Saskia to recover, I do. But don\\'t ask me to turn this town into a circus just before we battle Henselt. My grandfather locked that gate for a good reason. Imagine if we could all go in there to look at those dreams. Dwarves, peasants, the Scoia\\'tael, Aedirnian nobles, even. All seeing the desires of others. Terrifying. It would be the end of Vergen.CECIL: What\\'s more, legend has it the oldest stolen dreams can become reality. And I don\\'t want nightmares stalking Vergen\\'s back alleyways come nightfall.GERALT: Open it. I\\'ll make it quick.CECIL: Stop pissing me off. You\\'re acting like a drunk suitor. No means no.GERALT: You know, don\\'t know if I should mention this, but the dream I found belongs to you.CECIL: What are you talking about?GERALT: It\\'s an embarrassing affliction, I imagine. Hell, even something of a political liability in your case. Some might even call you a freak. You\\'re the alderman, an ages-old tradition is vested in you. On top of that, you now lead the preparations for Vergen\\'s defense.CECIL: You wouldn\\'t dare.GERALT: Imagine your ancestors carved in stone, condemnation, not pride, on their bearded faces. Who knows, maybe you\\'d keep your office, but you\\'d be the talk of the town for ages. And your nephew? Poor kid.CECIL: I\\'ll open the gate.CECIL: I promised Skalen\\'s mother I\\'d be sober as a judge to the end of my days. And I aim to keep my word. I don\\'t give a damn about ages-old traditions and piss on loose talk. But you\\'re right, I cannot compromise Vergen\\'s morale. You must bury this thing. The secret dies with you, never to be spoken aloud. Understand?GERALT: I do. Thanks, Cecil. And good luck staying sober.[Geralt goes to the old quarry and, fighting harpies as he goes, enters the lair. Along the way, he picks up several crystals. At the end, Geralt encounters a large circular monument with a space in the center. As he watches, a harpy flies up and places a purple crystal in the center notch, and the contents of the dream are shown.][In the dream, Letho hands Demavend\\'s head to Auckes.]LETHO: The head of a king. Take it to Síle, you know where. She\\'ll give you coin and further orders.AUCKES: Heavy. How am I supposed to carry it through the forest? I won\\'t be able to draw my sword.LETHO: You\\'ll go unarmed, in common clothes. Try to sneak through unnoticed, but if anyone asks - you\\'re bringing the witch some sausages.AUCKES: You can see it a mile away! And it stinks of vinegar! I have to find a thick sack.LETHO: Go on, quit complaining. There\\'s no time.[Geralt puts the other crystals in the viewer to look at.][The silver crystal shows a dwarf running away from something, trying to reach a door.]BALTIMORE: ...by the gods, they\\'re closer and closer... They\\'ll not catch me... To the workshop... They\\'ll not find it there... Over my dead body, whoresons! Ye\\'ll never fathom Master Baltimore\\'s secrets! It\\'s not far now...[The blue crystal shows Iorveth contentedly smoking a pipe while sitting at a table piled with food, while a pig roasts in the nearby fireplace. No one else appears to be in the room.]IORVETH: Esseat\\'h maonne! Tall aeste imn pae\\'donne. Iluren, meth ilurien! Feredain oel daommas![The green crystal shows Saskia laying back on a pallet and stretching.]PEASANT: You\\'re as beautiful as an elf, m\\'Lady.SASKIA: Come to me, my hero. Let\\'s fuck in the barn.PEASANT: Ah, the luck. To think I wanted to play dice with the others...SASKIA: Call them, too. It\\'ll be lovely.[The red crystal shows a view from high above; the edge of a huge wing can be seen. The dragon turns its head and looks down to reveal a castle wall with three tiny figures on it - as it flies closer, it becomes clear the figures are Geralt, Roche, and Foltest at the castle of the La Valettes, just before Geralt and Foltest made it to the solar.][Geralt brings the dragon\\'s dream back to Philippa.]GERALT: I found a stolen dream. It seems powerful. I think it\\'s a dragon\\'s dream.PHILIPPA: Excellent! That should do nicely. Come back and see me when you have the remaining ingredients.GERALT: I found something else in the harpy lair.PHILIPPA: What?GERALT: It looked to me like the kingslayer\\'s dream.PHILIPPA: And what did you see?GERALT: Foltest\\'s killer... He mentioned Demavend\\'s death... And Síle.PHILIPPA: Síle de Tansarville?GERALT: It looks like your colleague knows a lot more than she\\'s prepared to admit.PHILIPPA: A dream proves nothing, though we also cannot dismiss it. You must be careful if you run into Síle. She\\'s a powerful sorceress. But without specific, material evidence, I can accuse her of nothing.[In search of information about immortelles, Geralt finds Zoltan, Cecil, Yarpen, Sheldon Skaggs, and Dandelion around a table at the inn.]YARPEN: Geralt, sit down! We haven\\'t yet celebrated your raid into the mist!YARPEN: Ah, sorry, sorry, where are my manners... Sheldon Skaggs, veteran of the battles of Sodden and Brenna...SHELDON: ...And all inns along the way!ZOLTAN: You\\'ve already met Vergen\\'s elder.CECIL: Greetings.DANDELION: Gentlemen! Not sure about you, but my throat\\'s parched from all these greetings.GERALT: Funny - those were the first words out of your mouth.SHELDON: Master Dandelion\\'s right! A round for everyone – on me!Let\\'s drink. GERALT: I\\'ll gladly wash the road\\'s dust from my throat. Especially in such good company.YARPEN: Ah, too bad Caleb Stratton\\'s not here. May he rest in peace.DANDELION: A worthy dwarf he was. Here\\'s to him.ZOLTAN: Sheldon, you\\'re lagging behind.SHELDON: I\\'ve got a little screw coming tonight.YARPEN: More reason to drink! Makes you more vigorous.SHELDON: My prick withers like an old crone\\'s tits if I drink.ZOLTAN: Then tie a carrot to it.CECIL: So, what brings you here, Geralt?I need to find an immortelle first. GERALT: I\\'d gladly drink, but Saskia was poisoned and time is of the essence.ZOLTAN: How can we help? Speak!GERALT: Have you ever heard of a plant called the dwarven immortelle?SHELDON: Have we? Do pigs have tight arses?ZOLTAN: To tell the truth, I\\'ve no idea, Skaggs.SHELDON: It\\'s just a saying.YARPEN: You\\'re the only one using it.SHELDON: Witcher, the immortelle... it appears most often near anthracite and aluminosilicate deposits.GERALT: Philippa needs it to heal Saskia.SHELDON: A rare curio, but there\\'s a mine nearby and who knows... You might find it deep underground.Heard of the Dun Banner and its standard? GERALT: Ever heard of a unit called the Dun Banner? Apparently they left their standard behind during the last war. I need to find it if I\\'m to lift the curse.CECIL: Aye, the standard lies in a crypt with the those of the unit who perished here.GERALT: Where\\'s this crypt?CECIL: Not the easiest place to find... Turn right past the market and look for a passage carved right through the rocks. That\\'ll lead you to a valley filled with tombs and crypts.DANDELION: To the fallen!Why are you fighting for Saskia? GERALT: Why are you dwarves fighting for Saskia?YARPEN: If I had a knack for business, I\\'d be sitting on my arse in my own inn, not giving a shit for this war. But what\\'s my trade? Axe-swinging, that\\'s what. And if I could get killed, I\\'d rather know what I\\'m risking my neck for.SHELDON: The woman\\'s cuckoo. Ready to spit in the emperor\\'s face, even. But I have to admit, she knows all about warcraft and, dammit, she\\'s right. Free Vergen, no matter if you\\'re a dwarf, man or mangy elf.ZOLTAN: Do you hear him, Zigrin? Down on the elves already, but I bet he wouldn\\'t sniff at thirty additional archers in battle.Where\\'s the mine? GERALT: Is the mine far?SHELDON: Not at all! It\\'s in Vergen itself, in the town\\'s upper quarter.CECIL: You\\'re eager for this expedition, but nobody told the witcher that the mine\\'s closed!SHELDON: Closed, that\\'s true, but it\\'s long overdue a cleaning. Weed out all the underground shit!GERALT: What are you talking about?CECIL: Not a month ago, miners started disappearing. Must\\'ve tapped the wrong vein and woken some scum from the deep. We wanted to send a crew of stout fellows in, but Saskia said she needs all the soldiers she can find up top and ready to defend the town. We closed the shaft, fearing the filth would emerge and overrun us all.ZOLTAN: Looks like we arrived just in time, eh Geralt?GERALT: So it seems. Let\\'s go.YARPEN: Right on! With this crew, we needn\\'t fear any monster! How about you, Sheldon? Coming with us, or staying around to get your fuck?SHELDON: Another chance like this won\\'t come around in a hurry. Fucking can wait - I\\'m with you!GERALT: Let\\'s meet at the mine\\'s entrance.[Geralt meets the four dwarves at the mine\\'s entrance.]CECIL: The witcher\\'s on board, we can go.Not yet. GERALT: I\\'m not ready to go in yet. I\\'ll be back soon.ZOLTAN: Hurry \\'fore we start crapping to kill the time.Let\\'s go. GERALT: Let\\'s get to work, my bearded friends.CECIL: Open the shaft, Skaggs.CECIL: If you kill off those monsters, the whole of Vergen will be grateful. I\\'m sure some coin would be found.ZOLTAN: We\\'ll keep that in mind, Cecil.YARPEN: So, Sheldon? You opened the shaft yet?SHELDON: Keep your pricks in your trousers, you can\\'t just plough forward all the time. A mine is like a lover, you need to be gentle, so she accepts you moist and hot.YARPEN: You and your musings, Sheldon.[Geralt and the dwarves enter the mine. Just inside the first door lies a dwarf\\'s corpse.]ZOLTAN: Poor son of a bitch... He almost got away.YARPEN: I think I heard something.GERALT: Yeah, they\\'re close.[Inside the next door is a pack of rotfiends, which Geralt and the dwarves defeat.]SHELDON: Damned carrion. That was close...ZOLTAN: What was that?GERALT: Necrophages. With this many appearing, they must have a nest nearby.YARPEN: Come on, show yourselves, I\\'ll let you taste my axe...SHELDON: Ooh, you\\'re makin\\' them shit bricks.YARPEN: Even then they\\'d stink less than you.[Geralt and the dwarves continue through the mines, fighting rotfiends. As they go, Geralt collapses the rotfiends\\' tunnels with grapeshot bombs for Cecil.]ZOLTAN: The miners tried to collapse this passage. I wonder what\\'s down below?YARPEN: Maybe some shit–filled necrophage cesspit?SHELDON: Or they hide the corpses they drag in down there.GERALT: Hey! Gentlemen, let\\'s focus on finding a dwarven immortelle, please.[As they approach the final passageway, Geralt\\'s medallion vibrates. A bullvore is guarding the patch of immortelle.]GERALT: Heads up, they approach.[Geralt and the dwarves defeat the bullvore.]YARPEN: Seems it was the last one.ZOLTAN: Let\\'s grab what we need and get out of here.[Geralt picks the immortelle, and they leave the mine.]ZOLTAN: Right, Geralt, looks like it\\'s all over.GERALT: Thanks for your help, Zoltan.ZOLTAN: Say nothing of it.YARPEN: Enough yapping, time for some vodka!SHELDON: First, I want to see if my fuck date\\'s still waiting.YARPEN: Just don\\'t strain yourself. It takes energy to drink with us, too, you know.[Geralt can also talk to Cecil if he collapsed all the necrophage tunnels, finishing the sidequest \"Hey, Work\\'s in the Mines.\"]GERALT: We killed most of the necrophages.CECIL: Most?GERALT: The passage to the lower level collapsed. They won\\'t get out. In time, they\\'ll die off and you can restart work.CECIL: Thank you, witcher, the whole of Vergen thanks you. Here\\'s your coin. Chivay, Skaggs and Zigrin will get the same.[Geralt returns to Philippa with the herb.]GERALT: I\\'ve found an immortelle.PHILIPPA: Excellent.[Geralt goes to talk to Stennis about getting some blood.]STENNIS: Pray tell, what compels you to disturb the Prince of Aedirn, witcher?GERALT: I have a few questions.STENNIS: And you believe I should answer them instead of setting my dogs on you?GERALT: I think Your Royal Highness has enough foes. Here, abroad, in Vengerberg.STENNIS: The intricacies of succession are not something I wish to discuss with an itinerant monster slayer.Succession is the topic of choice in about every inn in the country. GERALT: Succession is the topic of choice in about every inn in the country. I don\\'t know for sure, but I think the hangman of Vengerberg was the last to claim the throne.STENNIS: My patience has its limits and, at present, only my respect for Lady Saskia restrains my anger. Come to the point or leave me be.Saskia will recover. GERALT: Saskia\\'s body is extremely resilient. She\\'ll recover soon.STENNIS: I heard the poison was deadly. How could the girl survive so long?GERALT: Toxins can lose their potency, and this is hardly the first time Saskia\\'s demonstrated an iron will. Besides, magic might be at play.STENNIS: Magic?GERALT: I\\'ll explain once I\\'ve confirmed it.[PERSUASION] Don\\'t change the subject. GERALT: Don\\'t change the subject, Prince.[FAILURE] STENNIS: How dare you speak to me that way?! Get out of my sight![SUCCESS] STENNIS: So be it. Let us set our differences aside and speak as equals.GERALT: Then tell me what you\\'re doing so far away from the capital. Why aren\\'t you in Vengerberg being crowned?STENNIS: Well sadly, my position is not strong there. My father emboldened the nobles. The great families have decided, in this hour so critical for the realm, to revolt.GERALT: Your title to the throne is indisputable.STENNIS: Aedirn has become a lawless land ruled by those who wield might, by those whom people follow. I intend to show just how worthy I am of the crown and thus claim what\\'s mine.GERALT: By returning to Vengerberg a hero. There should be no shortage of opportunities here.STENNIS: I don\\'t like your tone, witcher.[AXII] Why aren\\'t you in the capital? GERALT: Tell me, why are you here and not in the capital?[FAILURE] STENNIS: Magic tricks? I carry a turtle stone, witcher. Begone![SUCCESS] STENNIS: The influential nobles seek to undermine my rightful claim to the throne. Unrest ripples through the kingdom. Saskia has muddled the minds of the peasants and the burghers demand more rights.GERALT: And your opponents are seizing the opportunity.STENNIS: The Umraut family, in addition to being wealthy and influential, is closely related to the royal line. They could halt my coronation and put forward their own candidate. The families that remain undecided are the key - they must back me. They will do so only once I\\'ve shown myself to be a strong candidate. And greatness is something I can achieve only here, at the center of events.GERALT: And in the process, steal a little fame from the Dragonslayer of Vergen.I need to know what\\'s hapenning in politics. Unfortunately. GERALT: You might be surprised, Prince, but I have more political experience than I\\'d like.STENNIS: The famous Geralt of Rivia! Invited to the table by Calanthe, Foltest\\'s little favorite. I\\'ve heard you\\'ve even parleyed with the emperor of Nilfgaard. Think I\\'m impressed?STENNIS: Calanthe is dead. Meve curses your name when she hears it. Foltest was murdered before your very eyes. And the emperor? As I heard it, he thought you insignificant.GERALT: Are you going somewhere with this?STENNIS: Indeed. You should know that a king sometimes needs a hired thug to take care of dirtier deeds. If the thug is naive enough, instead of reaching into his purse, the king buys him with virtuous words, the flash of his rings, pledges of friendship. And when, having done his deed, the thug departs, swaggering proudly like a peacock, the king discreetly giggles. Truly, I never thought you could be so pitiful.I need royal blood. GERALT: I need royal blood.STENNIS: As you know, I\\'ve yet to be crowned.GERALT: But blood of your royal ancestors flows through your veins.STENNIS: True, but that doesn\\'t mean I\\'ll shed a drop for some vagabond. Are you a witcher or a vampire?GERALT: I need it to save Saskia.STENNIS: I need it to live. Don\\'t bother me with such audacious proposals.[Geralt begins gathering information about the symbolic magical artifacts necessary to deal with the curse, starting with Philippa.]PHILIPPA: You wanted to discuss something?I have some questions about the curse. GERALT: At the council you mentioned artifacts were needed to undo the curse.PHILIPPA: Mm. But I can\\'t look for them now.GERALT: I can do that.PHILIPPA: Why?GERALT: I have my reasons. Tell me something...What happened here three years ago? GERALT: What happened here three years ago?PHILIPPA: Henselt attacked Aedirn, but met his match. Nobody won that war. Sabrina Glevissig got into a conflict with the commander-in-chief of the Kaedweni forces and this led to both armies being routed. Fireballs turned the battlefield into a flaming tomb. Henselt accused Sabrina of using a forbidden weapon.GERALT: And Sabrina cursed Henselt?PHILIPPA: I think so. I suspect the curse got out of hand because of the circumstances.GERALT: Circumstances? The stars weren\\'t right, wrong phase of the moon? There\\'s always an excuse for simple bungling...PHILIPPA: She placed the curse while burning at the stake, her hands and feet nailed to a wagon wheel. I\\'d say she did a good job, considering.Not all the ghosts were aggressive. Did you notice? GERALT: Did you notice? Not all the ghosts were aggressive.PHILIPPA: Yes... Most just disappeared when they touched the aura of a living person.GERALT: I think the curse corrupts the ghosts of the fallen and turns them into draugirs.PHILIPPA: Is that the witchers\\' professional name for wraiths?GERALT: Draugirs are demons of war. They arise at sites of exceptionally vicious, bloody battles. They\\'re bloodlust and hatred in condensed form.PHILIPPA: Can you kill them by conventional means?GERALT: A silver sword is enough for a draugir. But as long as the curse remains active, new ones will arise. The soldiers\\' ghosts are the key. If I could turn the tide of the battle...PHILIPPA: For that you\\'ll need symbols of war belonging to those who fell in battle. Hatred, death, courage, and faith - all artifacts must be magically active and connected to the fallen or they won\\'t lure the ghosts.GERALT: Right, I\\'ll look around.PHILIPPA: Finding two will be enough. Get the symbols of hatred and death and leave the rest to me.GERALT: I\\'d prefer courage and faith...PHILIPPA: Don\\'t fuss.GERALT: I\\'ll see what I can do. Cecil seems to know a lot about the area...[If Geralt has already spoken to Cecil] I know who has the symbol of hatred. GERALT: I know who has the symbol of hatred.PHILIPPA: Yes...?GERALT: Saskia has the sword of \\'The Visitor\\' - Vandergrift, the worst son of a bitch to ever come out of the Kaedweni wilderness.PHILIPPA: Perfect. I\\'m sure she\\'ll give you her favorite toy... As soon as she\\'s cured.Know anything about blood curses? GERALT: Know anything about blood curses?PHILIPPA: Do you?GERALT: We\\'re dealing with a fourth level curse, also known as \"The Curse of the Arch Mistress.\"PHILIPPA: Well, well... I\\'m impressed.GERALT: Thing is, until now I thought it was only a myth, that such a curse couldn\\'t be cast.PHILIPPA: You thought wrong. There are six confirmed cases of this curse being inflicted.GERALT: What about confirmed cases of it being lifted?PHILIPPA: One. Achieved by a team of sorcerers led by Arch Mistress Francesca Findabair - hence the curse\\'s other name. Sabrina Glevissig was on the team...GERALT: Small world.PHILIPPA: That\\'s not all. The curse investigated by Francesca and Sabrina was designed to end the Thyssen dynasty, the rulers of Kovir. They were cursed by Scarlet Rodallega, a complete madman, but very talented. An eclipse and wraiths also accompanied his curse.GERALT: So, Sabrina\\'s curse is just a knock-off Rodallega.PHILIPPA: Exactly.What did Francesca learn? GERALT: Can Francesca\\'s experience help us?PHILIPPA: Certainly. I know the symbols and the workings of the curse thanks to her.GERALT: Care to explain? I\\'m the one risking my neck.PHILIPPA: You\\'ll have to re-live the battle and change its course at the right moment. I don\\'t know exactly what will happen. Nobody does.GERALT: Mm... I\\'ll look for those artifacts.I know enough. GERALT: I\\'m good for now. I\\'ll let you know when I learn something.[There are a few different people Geralt can talk to about the battle at Brenna. First is Yarpen.]GERALT: Did you fight at Brenna?YARPEN: Ah, fuck, I knows you\\'ve got amnesia, but you coulda remembered that!YARPEN: Ah, it was a beautiful day. On one side, six and forty thousand Black Ones - on the other, us, the Nordlings together. The Redanians led by De Ruyter on the left, the Temerian regiments in the middle... And us on the right, the Mahakam Volunteer Army - all dwarves. Even the likes of Coehoorn must\\'ve shit his britches at the sight of us.GERALT: He hardly lacked courage, as I heard it.YARPEN: A right brave bastard, that\\'s true. Preferred to die than run like a rat. I don\\'t believe I\\'ve ever seen a bigger melee, except maybe three years ago, here at Vergen. We\\'d have managed that day, too, even without the magic - that burning shit that fell from the sky. Why, even the Dun Banner knelt before us when we brought our battleaxes down.GERALT: Some say not one of the Dun Banner survived. Any truth to that?YARPEN: Biggerhorn nabbed the survivors as they fled south, but most men of the Banner lie in the catacombs - along with their standard. The Dun Banner - what the hell kind of name is that for a unit anyway? It\\'s as if they couldn\\'t get their fuckin\\' flag clean.[Stennis also has some information about the battle.]GERALT: I\\'m trying to figure out where this fog came from. What exactly happened here three years ago?STENNIS: Henselt\\'s mages committed mass murder. A dark day for the knighthood and all people of honor. But it was honor that allowed us to survive. There was no defeat, no victory. Honor stood against wickedness. Virtue against black magic.GERALT: You took part in that battle?STENNIS: My father stayed in the capital. He was to defend Vengerberg. I took to the field. I wanted to stop Henselt before he crossed the Pontar, but I was too late. So I decided to await him at Vergen.STENNIS: Henselt\\'s army was exhausted. We would have triumphed, if not for that heinous act. Henselt had mages with him, and they cast a treacherous spell on the entire battlefield. A fiery rain fell from the heavens - destructive, murderous embers which brought the battle to an end. I gathered the few survivors and withdrew deep into the country. The soldiers were terrified, but Henselt showed no desire to pursue.You pretty much wrote Vergen off. GERALT: You wrote Vergen off.STENNIS: There\\'s a place in Kaedwen where orphans are subjected to cruel experiments. Nine out of ten boys perish from the pain. Sound familiar? They say that sacrifices are necessary to create one witcher, one hero to defend the people against monsters.GERALT: Not the best analogy.STENNIS: You know nothing of military strategy and you\\'ve never been responsible for a nation\\'s fate. Which is why I forgive you your ignorance.Who cast the spells? GERALT: Only a master mage could\\'ve cast such a powerful spell. And I suspect he could not have accomplished it alone.STENNIS: I remember Sabrina Glevissig. Through the flames I saw her observing the carnage from her mount, dressed in a hunting suit - straight-backed, dispassionate.GERALT: Sabrina... If I remember correctly, she\\'s Henselt\\'s advisor.STENNIS: Was. Henselt condemned her to death for casting that spell. The Kaedwenis roasted in their armor just the same way the Aedirnians did. You know what struck me when all hell broke loose, what I found astonishing and even amusing?STENNIS: Going into battle we sang our Aedirnian songs. They intoned their Kaedweni hymns to Kreve. But when fire descended from the sky, our cries of pain were no different. We all wailed as humans. For an instant, the magnitude of the tragedy brought together our two warring nations.GERALT: I still have no idea where the spectral fog came from.STENNIS: I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know either.[Finally, Geralt can go speak to Cecil.]GERALT: Cecil, do you know anyone who fought in the war three years ago?CECIL: I did.GERALT: Did you fight here at Vergen?CECIL: Course.GERALT: Philippa claims you know a bit about the battle?CECIL: That old kook Henselt, called king by some, thought that Aedirnians were bumpkins who\\'d shit bricks as soon as his troops crossed the river.GERALT: Why did he attack Aedirn?CECIL: According to Henselt, Upper Aedirn is the ancient legacy of the Kaedweni crown and must be returned to the mother country. Brazen farter.GERALT: That brazen farter had a point. If you read some history, you\\'ll know that three hundred years ago this land belonged to Kaedwen.CECIL: Load of crap! Seven hundred years ago the elves reigned here! And a million years ago these lands were the domain of the worms! If things worked that way, every king could invade a neighboring land and claim his right to do so because an ancestor took a dump there!GERALT: All right... Henselt wanted to conquer Upper Aedirn. What then?CECIL: He rolled in, got hammered, and rolled out.GERALT: Cecil, that doesn\\'t help me much...CECIL: It wasn\\'t a battle, it was a slaughter. If I try speaking of it, I\\'ll see it all again... I don\\'t want...GERALT: The ghosts of the fallen fight in the mist. They turn into horrible creatures called draugirs. Aedirnians, Kaedweni... men, elves... And dwarves too.CECIL: Bloody hell. No peace even after death.GERALT: I want to help them. But I need to know more about the battle.CECIL: Very well, listen...CECIL: A beautiful day... that grew hot later. Very hot. When Vandergrift attacked in the afternoon, he sent the Dun Banner at the fore. Many of our lads shit themselves at the mere sight of their standard. But we had a surprise of our own. Under the cover of night we\\'d prepared fire pits. Our archers lit them up at the right moment. I still can\\'t believe we managed to fool their scouts. If it wasn\\'t for that ambush, we wouldn\\'t be speaking today. There likely wouldn\\'t be an Upper Aedirn at all.CECIL: We decimated the Dun Banner, but that was only the beginning. Seltkirk was our commander. Everywhere he appeared, the Kaedwenis gave ground. He wreaked havoc among them. Hearts rose at the mere sight of his armor. Then Vandergrift himself entered the fray. Seltkirk met him in the middle of the field. In the end, Vandergrift killed Seltkirk. A terrible death that sent the Aedirnian ranks into disarray.CECIL: I thought it was the end of us... Then the sky fell. As if the stars themselves had decided to avenge the death of a great knight. Fire covered the battlefield. Nobody sought the enemy. They were all looking for somewhere to flee.CECIL: Yeees... There were no more friends and enemies, only the living and the dead. They say it was the doing of a Kaedweni sorceress who wanted revenge on Vandergrift. Could be true, as Henselt had her executed right after the battle.How did the battle start? GERALT: Remember anything from before the battle?CECIL: As if it was yesterday. Henselt\\'s troops crossed the Pontar the third day after the autumn equinox. Aedirn had good spies, so we were ready for them, and Seltkirk lined up our troops along the hills.CECIL: Our hearts rose at the sight of the banners of Vengerberg, Aldersberg and Gulet fluttering in the wind... Knights and armored infantry side by side in our ranks... Even the peasants had their regiments. The dwarves were on the left flank. Over five thousand strong we were. Nobody caring about race or background. Like never before. Only King Demavend was missing. But he must have had more important business than defending his country.Did you see the Kaedwenis cross? GERALT: You saw the Kaedwenis cross the river?CECIL: From afar. I saw Vandergrift leading four thousand heavily armed men. Many a heart sank when we saw the elite Bear Heads or the armored banners from Ard Carraigh. The Dun Banner was in the middle - veterans of Brenna.CECIL: As soon as he set foot on Aedirnian land, Vandergrift climbed a hill and surveyed the area, as if it was his fief. Son of a bitch was as sure of himself as ever. Upon spying him, I remember the dwarves all dropped their trousers and showed him their arses.CECIL: Then Seltkirk stepped out in front of us. His white armor shone in the sun. We were afraid a Kaedweni arbalist would shoot him, but they, too, stood as if frozen. And Seltkirk just looked at them and bowed ever so slightly.Did you see the duel between Seltkirk and Vandergrift? GERALT: Did you see the duel between Seltkirk and Vandergrift?CECIL: I stood half a furlong from them. Never seen a fight like it. Probably never will again.CECIL: They\\'d already met once. At a jousting tournament in Ard Carraigh. Seltkirk won there. He beat on The Visitor so hard he broke his sword. Seltkirk was a true knight, the last of his breed. Vandergrift was so pissed off after that tournament he hanged the smith who made his sword and ordered a special one, from a sorcerer. I bet he cut down Seltkirk with that new sword.GERALT: Vandergrift is dead. What happened to his sword?CECIL: Saskia\\'s got it. Good thing, too. Only her hand can tame the hatred enchanted in that sword. After the battle, when the flames abated, the scavengers came. They stole everything. Imagine - not a single keepsake of Seltkirk in the whole of Aedirn. His brother babbled something about a gauntlet, but he\\'s a lying dog.What happened to the Dun Banner? GERALT: You captured the Dun Banner\\'s standard?CECIL: Henselt\\'s choice troops and not a one survived. The Visitor sent them to their deaths. Refused to give them reinforcements. He was a monster in human form. The men of the Dun were real swaggerers. Killed a lot of our lads, but for every Dunner there were seven Aedirnians... They had no chance.CECIL: Aye, we captured their standard. We buried what was left of them in the crypts beyond Vergen. Their standard lies with them. Worthy foes are to be respected, even in death.GERALT: I\\'m going to need that standard.Thanks, Cecil. I know what to look for now. GERALT: Thanks. Cecil, that was helpful. I think I know what I need to lift the curse now.CECIL: Madame Eilhart claims you need four symbols... The standard symbolizes death, Vandergrift\\'s sword stands for hatred. What about the other two...?GERALT: I have a feeling Philippa has a handle on the rest.CECIL: Here\\'s hopin\\' you\\'re right.[Geralt goes to the the dwarven catacombs and makes his way to the burial place of the Dun Banner. As he enters the room, a wraith manifests.]GHOST OF EKHART: Who are you and what do you seek?GERALT: Geralt of Rivia. I seek the standard of the Dun Banner. Who are you?EKHART: Ekhart Henessy - ensign and color bearer of the Dun Banner, the best force to issue from the land of Kaedwen.Killing you will be easiest. GERALT: Go back where you belong, corpse.[Geralt banishes Ekhart\\'s wraith.]I served in the Banner. GERALT: You may not remember me, but I remember you.EKHART: Where from?GERALT: I served in the Dun Banner.EKHART: Liar!GERALT: I fought beneath its standard at Brenna and at Vergen...[The ghost decides to test Geralt\\'s knowledge of the battle to prove his claim.][If Geralt gives a wrong answer][If Geralt won the cloak from dice poker with Skalen] EKHART: You wear the wool coat of the Dun Banner. If not for that, you would be a dead man. Try once more.[If Geralt found the Beaver\\'s Cap during Baltimore\\'s Nightmare]EKHART: If not for the beaver cap you wear, I would speak to you no longer. Try once more.[If Geralt did not get the items or has answered wrong already] EKHART: You lie! You are not of the Dun Banner and you must die!EKHART: The Battle of Brenna... The Nordlings shoulder to shoulder against the Black Ones. The Redanians led by De Ruyter on the right... Natalis leading Temeria on the left. A splendid sight, was it not?You got it wrong. GERALT: You\\'re mistaken. The Redanian regiments were on the left, the Temerians took the center.EKHART: Correct. Perhaps you speak the truth...GERALT: Try me again.EKHART: Tell me, for this you must know... Who was chief commander of the Nilfgaardians at Brenna?Menno Coehoorn. GERALT: Menno Coehoorn.EKHART: I\\'m beginning to believe you. Menno Coehoorn... The repulsive head hound of the Nilfgaardian pack. But a great commander. He will again let the Nordlings\\' blood. Would you agree?Coehoorn is dead. GERALT: Your memory has suffered after death. Coehoorn perished. At Brenna.EKHART: You are vigilant. I could not deceive you.GERALT: Because I am of the Dun Banner.EKHART: Perhaps you did fight at Brenna... It was so long ago... I may have forgotten you... But Vergen is another matter...GERALT: I can\\'t answer for the state of your memory.EKHART: You are right... Memory often fails us after death. I cringe to admit I\\'ve forgotten who commanded the armies during the Battle of Vergen, perhaps the most important day of my life. And the last... Be so good as to remind me...Vandergrift and Seltkirk. GERALT: Seltkirk led Aedirn, Vandergrift led us.EKHART: Well done. Not all know that. Some believe that the kings commanded the armies during the battle... Or that their mages did...GERALT: Do you believe me yet?EKHART: Not yet, but I shall when you tell me how you survived the massacre at Vergen.Biggerhorn took me prisoner. GERALT: Most men of the Dun died, the survivors withdrew south. The fires blocked our way back to our lines and we fell into Biggerhorn\\'s trap.EKHART: I know the cowardly bastard.EKHART: You have proven that you served in the Dun Banner.GERALT: May I take the standard?EKHART: Why do you desire it so?GERALT: It will help me lift a curse.EKHART: Curses are of no import to me.GERALT: This one should be. It has stopped King Henselt\\'s army from advancing.EKHART: The Unicorn has returned?GERALT: He stands at Vergen\\'s gates. With your help, he\\'ll avenge the Dun Banner.EKHART: The standard lies in the sarcophagus. Take it. You will also find the sword of Colonel Gondor. Now, it is yours.GERALT: Thank you.EKHART: Where have you left your mount?GERALT: There are no horses here.EKHART: True. I would gladly drink with a brother from Brenna, but I am an unfettered soul, strong drink means nothing, tastes of nothing. Perhaps I miss that most in death. Guard the standard. I grasped it firmly even as they cut me down.[Geralt retrieves the standard and the Dun Banner sword from the sarcophagus and leaves.]  4.08 - WHERE IS TRISS MERIGOLD: THE TROLLS < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to ask Philippa if she has any leads on Triss.]PHILIPPA: You wanted to discuss something?I\\'m looking for Triss. GERALT: I\\'m looking for Triss. Letho forced her to teleport near Vergen.PHILIPPA: Letho?GERALT: Foltest\\'s killer. Perhaps Demavend\\'s, too. Will you help me find her?PHILIPPA: Certainly. We sorceresses must stick together. We have too many enemies.GERALT: Triss contacted you through Síle de Tansarville\\'s megascope while in Flotsam.PHILIPPA: And I haven\\'t heard from her since.GERALT: Can you locate her?PHILIPPA: A megascope responds to a person\\'s aura. If I had something of hers I could find her. You were close to her, maybe you have something?GERALT: No, I don\\'t have anything.PHILIPPA: Not good... Wait... A local drunkard claims he saw a redhead fall out of the sky. This could be a lead.You want me to take a drunkard seriously? GERALT: Drunkards say all sorts of nonsense. One claimed his dog was writing poetry.Triss is hardly the only redhead around. GERALT: There are many redheads.Fall out of the sky, eh? GERALT: I never heard of flying women before.PHILIPPA: Perhaps they\\'re just drunken delusions. It\\'s possible, however, that an unstable teleport ejected Triss near the town.GERALT: As it\\'s our only lead, I\\'ll talk to this drunkard. Do you know him?PHILIPPA: I\\'m not used to associating with drunkards, but you\\'ll likely find him in the inn.GERALT: Thank you.PHILIPPA: Come back as soon as you learn anything.[Geralt goes to the tavern to talk to the drunkard, Martus Birut, who is hanging around by the innkeeper\\'s counter.]MARTUS: Let me tell you about the woman who fell from the sky...INNKEEPER: Ah, you\\'ve told that story a thousand times! I\\'ve heard enough of flying women!MARTUS: It was very unusual...INNKEEPER: What would be unusual is if you returned home sober for once. You won\\'t trick me into buying you a round.GERALT: I heard you saw something interesting.MARTUS: As clearly as I see you! Amazing! I look into the sky...MARTUS: But wait... You must buy a fellow a drink for such a story.INNKEEPER: Will you shut it already?! We could all recite this bullshit now.MARTUS: I\\'m a client and I\\'ll say what I want. Pour me some Mahakaman mead, and no cheating! This noble wayfarer will pay.Not sure if it\\'s worth it. GERALT: I\\'m not about to buy a pig in a poke.MARTUS: Not a pig, but a beeeautiful woman, and not in a poke, in the sky. You won\\'t regret it.Maybe you can tell me, innkeeper? GERALT: Innkeeper, you said you could recite the story. Tell me.INNKEEPER: If you pay for two bottles of mead this drunkard guzzled.MARTUS: The innkeeper\\'s too dumb to tell such a beeeautiful story.The innkeeper\\'s sober. GERALT: But he\\'s sober. How much for those bottles?INNKEEPER: This is no luxury establishment - just look at the clientele. Same price you\\'d see anywhere.[NOT ENOUGH COIN] GERALT: I\\'m a little short right now.[SUCCESS] GERALT: Tell me.INNKEEPER: A few days ago, a redheaded woman and a huge man appeared in the gullies, as if they\\'d fallen from the sky. The man left, while a troll found the woman and took her deep into a ravine.GERALT: That\\'s all?MARTUS: No! I told you this tongue wagger would ruin my story!INNKEEPER: That was exactly your story. Just not embellished.MARTUS: If you want to know the whole story, you\\'ll have to pay for my mead.I know all I need. GERALT: I know all I need. Godspeed.I\\'ll speak with the drunkard after all. [Contines same as \"I\\'ll pay.\"]I\\'ll pay. [NOT ENOUGH COIN] GERALT: I\\'m a little short right now.[SUCCESS] GERALT: I\\'ll pay. But if you bore me, I\\'ll shove this mead up your ass.MARTUS: Such a fine liquor, and my arse has no taste. You won\\'t regret it.GERALT: Speak.MARTUS: Last week I was passing by the gullies. I like to take a hike from time to time...GERALT: Get to the point.MARTUS: Hush... So I\\'m walking and suddenly there\\'s a flash... a crack... I\\'m thinking, \"a storm\\'s coming,\" but nary a cloud in the sky.INNKEEPER: You hit the ground with your arse so hard, you saw a flash. You were that drunk.MARTUS: Then I saw people lying in a gully, as if they\\'d fallen from the sky! A man and a woman. The woman was so beautiful, I wished she\\'d fallen down on me.What did she look like? GERALT: What did the woman look like?MARTUS: A redhead. Wearing a vest and high shoes, with pert tits and a round arse... Just waiting to to be grabbed and... mmmhff.INNKEEPER: Sounds just like your old lady.MARTUS: Shut your mouth!Who was the man? GERALT: Did you get a good look at the man?MARTUS: Huge fellow! His mug cut up like he shaved with a scythe while drunk.GERALT: What happened then?MARTUS: Well... the woman was hurting, couldn\\'t get up. The man clearly disliked her \\'cause he didn\\'t help her. Just stood there, menacing and talking. And then he left and the redhead stayed.INNKEEPER: Noticed her tits, but didn\\'t even try to help her, you sod.MARTUS: I was about to do exactly that, when a troll came out of the gully. Ugly as shit after blueberries!GERALT: Did it attack her?MARTUS: Not at all. I hid and saw everything. First he sniffed her, so I though he\\'d eat her. But he didn\\'t... He threw her over his shoulder like a sack and returned to the gullies.GERALT: Is that all?MARTUS: Yes. Didn\\'t waste your money, as you\\'ll agree.[Geralt heads out. He finds the troll in the ravines, stirring a cauldron surrounded by elf bones.]TROLL: Who there?!GERALT: A witcher.TROLL: Bumpkins wisha send to me kill? So be. Kill. Quick. No pain.[If Geralt spoke to Martus] GERALT: First tell me - where\\'s the woman you kidnapped?TROLL: Kidnap none! I troll!GERALT: A dwarf saw you carrying a human woman.TROLL: Midge stupid. Sick she - me carry. Her help, feed, pet, but she run go... Missus first run go, redhead then. All gone. Soup only stay.[If Geralt didn\\'t speak to Martus] GERALT: Why do you want to die?TROLL: Live why? Me missus me want no more. Be lone - be terrible.GERALT: What\\'s in the pot?TROLL: Soup - elf and onion. Gooood. Want try?I don\\'t like onions. GERALT: I don\\'t really care for onions.TROLL: Stupid wisha. Elf good taste with onions... Tomato like.Where did you get the ingredients? GERALT: Where did you get the elves?TROLL: Missus bring from gullies, like I bring redhead...GERALT: The redhead\\'s in the soup, too?TROLL: No. Redhead run go. Missus run go. All gone, only soup stay.What happened? Tell me from the start. GERALT: Tell me, troll. What happened here?TROLL: Me in gullies, missus in gullies. Bones found, nice to gnaw. Then wham! Humies from sky fall!GERALT: You\\'re lying, troll. People don\\'t fall from the sky.TROLL: Troll true tell. Flash! Crack! Two humies drop where dumbles\\' ship. Humie man, big as troll, and womyn. I go see...GERALT: Was the man bald? Did he have a scar?TROLL: Wisha man likes man? See I from far. Bald, yes. Scar no see. Run he go to gullies, leave redhead humie... Dumb.TROLL: See I go. Redhead groan. Her pain. Closer I creep. Run she not go. Leg her grow. Take me humie womyn, go home.TROLL: Missus angry. Call humie wench thinbones. Hungry missus, yap and yap, then run go own for food. Give water redhead humie. Leaves cover leg. Humie redhead nice, pet she when sleeps. Redhead have kerchief, nice to sniff...TROLL: Missus come back, elfs in hand. Drop thinwench, idgit, she call. Missus yap \"Rag give.\" Troll say not - nice to feel, stench troll like. Missus say: \"She or me.\" Nice redhead, nice rag stench. Troll missus tell. Missus troll with log beat and run go. Even left elfs...GERALT: What happened to the redhead?TROLL: Redhead wrongpain, redhead stay. Pain gone, redhead run go. At night - troll sleep. Windhowl empty.Do you have the redhead\\'s bandanna? GERALT: Do you still have the redhead\\'s bandanna?TROLL: No. Missus take away. Old bug leave elfs, rag steal, and run go.GERALT: Where did she go, your...wife?TROLL: Gullies. Missus gullies like, gullies me like...GERALT: Why don\\'t I look for her?TROLL: Wisha missus no kill. Good old bug. Little batty.I won\\'t kill her. GERALT: I won\\'t hurt your woman.TROLL: Missus tell come back. Be lone - be terrible. Windhowl empty.GERALT: Fine. I\\'ll tell your mate to come back. But I need the redhead\\'s bandanna.TROLL: Missus have. Missus good, she upgive. Soon as she back.We\\'ll see. GERALT: I can\\'t promise you that...TROLL: Good troll be. Redhead run go. Missus get come back.GERALT: You could\\'ve petted and sniffed the redhead a little less...TROLL: Troll care, troll help! Wisha now help. No wisha help, troll kill!I won\\'t hurt your woman. [Same as \"I won\\'t kill her.\" above.]I don\\'t like to be threatened. GERALT: Out of my way.TROLL: Wisha to soup![Troll attacks, and Geralt kills him.][Geralt continues through the ravines looking for the she-troll. Ahead he hears sounds of fighting, and comes on the she-troll being attacked by heavily-armored mercenaries. Standing by and watching are Adam Pangratt and another mercenary.]PANGRATT: She\\'s wounded. Let her bleed.MERCENARY: Better lunge at her all at once. She\\'s weakened.PANGRATT: Not worth the risk...GERALT: What are you doing here?PANGRATT: We\\'re mercenaries, currently on King Henselt\\'s pay. We were sent here on reconnaissance. Barely escaped with our lives from that mist of specters. Now we\\'re up against a furious she-troll. Who are you?GERALT: Geralt of Rivia.MERCENARY: The White Wolf! We could use professional help, witcher.PANGRATT: Will you help us?She needs to live. GERALT: I can\\'t let you kill her.MERCENARY: Since when does a monster slayer take their side?!GERALT: None of your business. I need her. And you need to leave.PANGRATT: She killed two of my men.GERALT: Walk away - and nobody else will get hurt.PANGRATT: You won\\'t help? Fine. Just don\\'t disturb us. We\\'ll manage ourselves.GERALT: The troll needs to live.PANGRATT: The troll will die.GERALT: Then you\\'ll have to kill me, too.PANGRATT: In that case - adieu, witcher.Agreed. GERALT: Yeah, I\\'ll help.PANGRATT: Excellent. Let\\'s make it quick.[Geralt either helps them kill the she-troll, or fights Adam\\'s mercenaries.][If Geralt helped them kill the troll] MERCENARY: She\\'s breathed her last. What now?[If Geralt fights the mercenaries] PANGRATT: Enough! We surrender. Throw down your arms, men! Spare us, witcher, the king will pay our ransom...GERALT: I\\'m not looking for a ransom. Leave the troll alone and go your way.PANGRATT: You\\'ll let us go?GERALT: You can\\'t return through the mist, it\\'s certain death.MERCENARY: We\\'re soldiers of fortune, we\\'re not afraid of death.PANGRATT: Neither do we foolishly seek it. The witcher\\'s right.MERCENARY: Commander, we were to find a witcher...PANGRATT: A bald one, with a snake medallion. This one\\'s white haired, with a wolf on his neck...You\\'re looking for Letho. GERALT: You\\'re looking for Letho.PANGRATT: You know him?GERALT: You could say that. I\\'m looking for him, too. What do you know about him?PANGRATT: Síle de Tansarville told us to search the ravines for this Letho. All we found was a camp strewn with dead Scoia\\'tael. This Letho was responsible for the bloodbath, and he did not act alone.GERALT: Where was this?PANGRATT: On the other side of the wraiths\\' mist.GERALT: What were you to do with him?PANGRATT: Kill him. And anyone with him.GERALT: Anyone? Are you sure?PANGRATT: That was the order.GERALT: Do you know where Letho is?PANGRATT: Somewhere on the other side of this mist. We found a trail, but then the mist descended. We got lost and emerged from it here.Surrender to Saskia. GERALT: I advise you to surrender to the rebels.PANGRATT: That would be new to me. I am Adam Pangratt, known as \"Adieu.\"GERALT: You won\\'t survive for long out here.MERCENARY: They\\'ll hang us. They know Henselt hired us.GERALT: Go to Cecil Burdon. He\\'ll treat you fairly. But don\\'t count on him outbidding Henselt.PANGRATT: Hear that boys?! Let\\'s meet the Dragonslayer. The witcher claims we\\'ll be safe and sound. Gather the wounded, stop buggering and move out![If Geralt killed the she-troll, he loots Triss\\' bandana from her corpse and, if he didn\\'t already kill him, has to kill her mate on the way back as well. Otherwise, the she-troll comes to thank him.]SHE-TROLL: Humies troll see, to kill humies itchy. Would kill troll, sure. You other. Goood you help. Troll you help.[If Geralt killed the other troll] GERALT: I know you\\'ve got something that belongs to my friend. The redhead.SHE-TROLL: Troll got redhead rag. Idgit it sniffed. Here. Take. Stink rag. Humie run go. Troll be lone.[If Geralt did not kill the other troll] GERALT: If you want to help me, go back to your old man.SHE-TROLL: No! Idgit humie redhead grope!GERALT: He\\'s alone now. He misses you.SHE-TROLL: Tell him, \"Too late!\"Know anything about the redhead? GERALT: Know anything about the woman who was in your lair?SHE-TROLL: Troll know! Humie ugly, humie stinks!GERALT: Return to your husband if you want to repay me.SHE-TROLL: Troll don\\'t want, but troll will. For you other, you good.[Geralt and the she-troll return to her mate.]TROLL: Missus back! Gooood. Troll like.SHE-TROLL: Me back for wisha asked. Stay away if wisha not ask.TROLL: Missus wise.SHE-TROLL: Idgit you. Humie womyn grope.TROLL: No more. Never \\'gain.GERALT: Give me the bandanna.SHE-TROLL: Here. Stupid old buck.TROLL: Troll give horn. In danger, wisha blow - troll come.GERALT: Thanks, I\\'ll remember that. Now go to your mate. Maybe pick her some flowers first.TROLL: Flowers no, flowers stench. Troll bring bird dung.SHE-TROLL: Idgit! What troll do in lair?TROLL: Nothin\\'...SHE-TROLL: Me see! Stench!TROLL: Stench will run go...SHE-TROLL: Humie stench! Sleep no me![Geralt returns to Philippa and gives her Triss\\' bandana.]GERALT: I\\'ve got Triss\\'s bandanna.PHILIPPA: Have you learned anything?GERALT: Triss was here. Letho forced her to teleport...PHILIPPA: Who\\'s Letho?GERALT: The kingslayer. I pursued him to Flotsam, but he gave me the slip, kidnapping Triss as he did. He forced her to teleport him here, to Vergen.PHILIPPA: Why would he? There are easier ways to travel.GERALT: Two of Letho\\'s comrades, probably those responsible for Demavend\\'s death, were hiding among the Scoia\\'tael. When it became evident in Flotsam that the kingslayer wanted to dispose of Iorveth, the Scoia\\'tael leader gave the order to eliminate them. Letho had to reach the unit before the elven messengers did. He could only do that by teleporting.PHILIPPA: I assume that Triss wanted to teleport to me, but she missed the mark and they ended up in the gullies. What happened next?GERALT: Letho left her in a gully, wounded. He probably thought that she\\'d diversify the local trolls\\' diet. He himself went to see the elves and massacred the unit with his comrades. They\\'re somewhere on the other side of the fog.PHILIPPA: What about Triss?GERALT: She escaped from the troll... Everything suggests she\\'s somewhere in the area.PHILIPPA: I can assure you she is not in Vergen...GERALT: She has to be here. Locate her.PHILIPPA: I\\'ll try, but it will take some time. Have you learned anything else?Síle ordered Letho and Triss killed. GERALT: Síle ordered Letho and Triss killed.PHILIPPA: I can\\'t believe that.GERALT: Believe it. I ran into some mercenaries she enlisted to kill Letho and anyone found with him.PHILIPPA: She must have meant the other kingslayers. Are you sure she knew Triss was with him?GERALT: Are you so sure of Síle? There was something going on between her and Triss... I sensed a lot of tension.PHILIPPA: A misunderstanding.GERALT: Maybe. Let\\'s find Triss and clear everything up.PHILIPPA: I need some time...Nothing worth mentioning. GERALT: Nothing worth mentioning.PHILIPPA: You\\'re lying – there is something else.GERALT: Stay out of my head.PHILIPPA: I\\'m sorry, I acted on instinct... In a few hours I should know what happened to Triss.PHILIPPA: What\\'s going on out there?GERALT: Let\\'s see.[Geralt and Philippa leave her quarters to find a noble on her doorstep.]PHILIPPA: What\\'s going on?NOBLE: The peasants want to take pitchforks to King Demavend\\'s son!GERALT: Why?NOBLE: The Dragonslayer\\'s servant is spreading rumors that Stennis poisoned Saskia. The commoners are in an uproar - they want to dispense justice.GERALT: Where\\'s the prince?NOBLE: Barricaded himself in his room, guarded by nobles. For the moment, the peasants are still respectful, but they are feverish. A fight is inevitable. Help us out, the situation is dire. I\\'m going to inform the other nobles.It was only a matter of time. GERALT: Dogs growl at cats. Cats hiss at the dogs. A noble\\'s a wolf to a peasant...PHILIPPA: Forget those animalistic similes and take care of it. I\\'ll try to locate Triss.I don\\'t like people like Stennis. GERALT: I\\'m not sure if Prince Stennis is guilty, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if he was involved.PHILIPPA: Power - the object of dark desire.GERALT: Let\\'s go, before this dark desire becomes too strong and someone gets hurt.PHILIPPA: You go, I\\'ll locate Triss.PHILIPPA: And should anything happen to Prince Stennis, remember... We need his blood.GERALT: I remember.  4.09 - ROYAL BLOOD: THE MOB < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt heads to the Castle of the Three Fathers, where Stennis\\' quarters are.]NOBLE 1: The commoners claim it\\'s our prince\\'s doing!NOBLE 2: Such judgment is above their station!NOBLE 3: I believe it\\'s Henselt\\'s provocation. He wants to drive a wedge between us![Outside Stennis\\' doorway, a mob of humans and a few dwarves are camped out.]DWARF 1: Serfs and lords will never be on the same side!DWARF 2: Humans only care how their arses rise as their stations do!DWARF 1: They\\'re playing into Henselt\\'s hands! If they start at each others\\' throats, we\\'ll have to face the entire might of Kaedwen alone!DWARF 2: You can\\'t mix water with fire.DWARF 1: Saskia could!DWARF 2: And you see what they did to her!KALTEN: Give us Stennis!NOBLE 1: The prince does not grant an audience.PEASANT 1: Then we\\'ll see how you like the pitchfork and get the bastard ourselves!SKALEN: Move along! Go in peace!PEASANT 2: Oh, there\\'s no peace if the criminal walks freely!NOBLE 2: Judging the prince is above your station!NOBLE: You won\\'t get the prince!KALTEN: A flail could hit your head, too!NOBLE: That would be murder! Murder of royal blood!KALTEN: Not murder. Plain justice! I\\'ll remember you. You\\'ll squeal and beg me to shiv you swiftly.[Geralt approaches the mob.]DANDELION: Geralt! It\\'s good to see you!ZOLTAN: The commoners claim Stennis is involved in Saskia\\'s poisoning. They\\'re looking to slaughter him.What\\'s stopping them? GERALT: What\\'s stopping them?DANDELION: The knights. Aedirnian noble lords...ZOLTAN: Not easy to raise a hand against a blue-blood.GERALT: A peasant by the name of Kalten was at the council. He didn\\'t seem to respect anything or anyone.ZOLTAN: Kalten\\'s a blackguard! He\\'ll use any excuse to raid and plunder.DANDELION: He has a taste for noble blood. They say he buries gold looted from the lords in some gorge.Nobody\\'s maintaining order? GERALT: Nobody to keep things peaceful?ZOLTAN: Skalen Burdon and his dwarves are trying to contain the mob, but they\\'re badly outnumbered.DANDELION: The plebs\\'ll yell a lot, beat someone up and go home. As peasants do.ZOLTAN: Don\\'t be foolish. They\\'re not serfs anymore. The days of them humbly sowing and reaping are gone.DANDELION: Looks like things are getting nasty.[Skalen and the nobles confront the mob.]SKALEN: Hear me!KALTEN: Whaddaya want?SKALEN: I\\'m Skalen Burdon. I keep order in Vergen.KALTEN: Oh, doin\\' a nice job, then! Where was you when they poisoned Saskia?!PEASANT: Give us the prince! Get the flails![Iorveth shoulders his way into the fray, flanked by Scoia\\'tael.]IORVETH: Stop!PEASANT: Iorveth...NOBLE: Squirrels...IORVETH: Everyone who wants to leave this yard in one piece - keep your hands off your weapons. I don\\'t care if you\\'re a serf or a lord. I\\'ll kill you all if need be.GERALT: What\\'s going on?KALTEN: The servant carrying wine during the feast said that Prince Stennis and Olcan poisoned Saskia! We want justice!GERALT: You want revenge. It\\'s not the same thing.KALTEN: We don\\'t care! Saskia\\'s fallen as if dead, while the poisoning prince and noble lords rush to herd us onto the field and sell us to Henselt. We won\\'t let them!NOBLE: You lie, Kalten. Nobody\\'s being sold out. The poisoner must be caught and tried by law.KALTEN: Your law? What then? He\\'ll pay a fine and get spanked on his arse? We\\'ll spank him all right - with an axe to the throat!GERALT: Where\\'s this servant?IORVETH: Safe. The Scoia\\'tael keep an eye on him.KALTEN: Why is the prince hiding in his house if he\\'s innocent?!IORVETH: Enough! I\\'ll shoot the first to reach for a weapon. Then heads will start falling.KALTEN: There\\'s more of us. You can\\'t kill every...IORVETH: Then you\\'ll be first. Now back off!KALTEN: Go get the lads! We won\\'t stand for this.PEASANT: Aughhhh...My hand!IORVETH: I\\'ll cut the block off the next man who dares try his luck.[Iorveth comes up to Geralt.]IORVETH: We need to act quickly.Huh? GERALT: We?IORVETH: The mob\\'s akin to a forest after a drought. One spark and the fire will be unstoppable.GERALT: I\\'m no peacekeeper and definitely no judge.IORVETH: We\\'re both in it, whether you like it or not.GERALT: Why are you getting involved?IORVETH: For her, Gwynbleidd. Certainly not for this rabble...What\\'s your plan? GERALT: What\\'s your plan?IORVETH: I\\'ll frighten them a little, bleed them if need be... I\\'ll buy you some time, but be swift, I can\\'t hold them off for long. Question the peasants and the nobles, and talk to the dwarves. Maybe you can get to meet Stennis.GERALT: Even if he\\'s guilty, I\\'m sure he\\'s prepared a suitable story.IORVETH: You\\'ll know how to sort the sheep from the goats. Also, find the servant who started talking so suddenly. You won\\'t have time to talk to everyone though, that\\'s for sure.[If Geralt comes back to check in] GERALT: Anything changed?IORVETH: Not really. The peasants keep hollering. The noblemen stubbornly guard their chieftain.[There are several groups of people Geralt can talk to, though in-game not all of them can be spoken to before the mob boils over. These groups are Dandelion and Zoltan, a noble hanging out by himself, the nobles outside Stennis\\' door, the trio of dwarves, the peasant mob, and Stennis himself.][Geralt talks to Dandelion and Zoltan.]ZOLTAN: Saskia\\'s on the bier with Henselt at the gates. Wraiths fill the mist and commoners and nobles are at each others\\' throats... Lovely.DANDELION: This is nonsense. What would the prince gain with the Virgin\\'s death?ZOLTAN: I can tell you what he lost with her life - power! As I see it, every princeling likes to scheme.DANDELION: Guilt must be proven! Otherwise it\\'s vigilante justice!ZOLTAN: I\\'ll grant you that, rhymester.ZOLTAN: Things look bad - the peasants are furious. They finally have a chance to strike back for all the wrongs.DANDELION: The noblemen won\\'t yield.ZOLTAN: They\\'re a cowardly lot.GERALT: They know their heads will follow Stennis\\'s.DANDELION: It\\'s a deadlock. With the prince\\'s guilt still to be proven.ZOLTAN: Yarpen says it\\'s someone from Aedirn. Sheldon, on the other hand, would shave his beard if it\\'s not Henselt\\'s spies.Anyone talked with the prince? GERALT: Anyone reached the prince in his chamber?DANDELION: Not even close! The nobles guard him like a matron does her ward\\'s heinie.ZOLTAN: If the rabble slaughters the prince, there\\'ll be no stopping them. They\\'ll start doing things their own nasty way.DANDELION: That\\'s why the nobles will support the prince even if they believe he\\'s guilty.ZOLTAN: I\\'m sure Stennis\\'s hands are dirtier than a peasant girl\\'s fucked in a barn.Why would Henselt do it? GERALT: Why would Sheldon suspect Henselt?DANDELION: He\\'d sooner reach an agreement with Stennis than Saskia. Her death would be very convenient...GERALT: Zoltan?ZOLTAN: I\\'m wondering how anyone could manage to poison the wine. Saskia\\'s a quick-witted lass. She doesn\\'t let just anyone near. Someone she knew must have done it.What Aedirnian could do it? GERALT: Has Yarpen got any evidence?ZOLTAN: No... Yarpen\\'s an old kook and says he\\'s got a \"feeling.\" Ploughing soothsayer.DANDELION: He might be right with those feelings. After all, not just anyone can pass through the wraiths\\' mist. It has to be someone local.ZOLTAN: So it never crossed your mind that Henselt might have sent someone here before those ghosts appeared?[If Geralt comes back to check in] GERALT: How are things over there?DANDELION: Nothing new. The serfs, like young wenches, are eager but scared.ZOLTAN: Everyone\\'s talking through their hats and the prince is still locked away.[Geralt talks to the single noble leaning against the wall.]LONE NOBLE: Witcher! Come here, I need to talk to you.GERALT: What do you want?LONE NOBLE: We of noble birth always had to protect the plebs from their own stupidity. If not for us, the world...GERALT: I don\\'t have time to listen to songs praising the nobility.Know anything about the attempt on Saskia\\'s life? GERALT: Know anything about the attempt on Saskia\\'s life?LONE NOBLE: No I don\\'t, but whatever the truth, the mob cannot lynch one of royal blood.GERALT: So truth means nothing to you. That\\'s what makes us different.LONE NOBLE: I didn\\'t say I don\\'t care about truth! Just keep in mind, there\\'s a world order that mustn\\'t be destroyed.GERALT: An order that allows injustice...LONE NOBLE: If the prince turns out to be involved in this attempted murder, he should face a tribunal. The rabble doesn\\'t understand the principles ruling the world.GERALT: Or they do understand them and simply don\\'t like them.LONE NOBLE: Saskia is a wise woman, but there\\'s one thing she doesn\\'t take into consideration: this war will be over one day. Who will sow the crops and milk the cows, then? Saskia called the serfs to arms. Do you think they\\'ll want to plough fields again?GERALT: You may be right. But it\\'s certainly not my business who\\'ll plough your fields. Farewell.LONE NOBLE: The prince is only the beginning... Kalten and his like won\\'t respect anyone or anything.LONE NOBLE: The world order, witcher. Keep it in mind![Geralt talks to the nobles outside Stennis\\' door.]PEASANT: Give us this whoreplougher!NOBLE: Roll in dung, you surly dog!PEASANT: You\\'ll change your tone when we put a sickle to your throat!NOBLE: Save your threats for your hog-smelling woman!GERALT: I\\'d gladly hear your opinion on the situation.NOBLE: Finally, someone reasonable! It\\'s obvious Henselt bribed some serf, who then did what he was told.A peasant would try to kill Saskia? GERALT: The local peasants love Saskia.NOBLE: Those surly dogs would gleefully accept a heavy pouch. Show me a serf with any sense of honor!Henselt\\'s far away. GERALT: Henselt couldn\\'t possibly reach Vergen.NOBLE: Doesn\\'t he have sorcerers at his court? Or perhaps he hired a witcher to break through. There\\'s no other explanation!Go on. GERALT: That\\'s interesting.NOBLE: Just think it through. The prince couldn\\'t have done it, the wine was in plain sight. Only the servants touched the decanters and who are they? Commoners! Then that same commoner incited his folk to stand against the nobles and the prince!GERALT: Something to think about...NOBLE: It\\'s Henselt\\'s doing![Geralt talks to the three dwarves.]DWARF 1: It\\'s good to see someone\\'s taking care of it!DWARF 1: The prince has it coming, me thinks.DWARF 2: Good! Bloody bastard poisoned the Virgin.GERALT: Can we have a word?OGDEN: Why not... I\\'m Ogden, a founder - I cast mugs, plates, chalices... You need any, witcher?GERALT: No, thanks. The tableware in the council chamber is your handiwork?OGDEN: It is. Made it back in Mayor Farragut\\'s time! Since then, each and every goblet has hit the floor dozens of times, and what happened? Nothing! Because they\\'re steel! My goblets are indestructible, impervious to both the fury of sovereigns and servants who are all thumbs.GERALT: Saskia\\'s chalice was new.OGDEN: Aye, it was. Back in Mayor Farragut\\'s day, I venture Saskia was no more than an itch in her da\\'s britches.Who commissioned the goblet? GERALT: Who ordered the goblet from you?OGDEN: That goblet was a gift, a way for the folk of Vergen to pay tribute to Saskia. I got the honor of casting and presenting it to our lovely leader... The lass liked it so much, she\\'s not used any other vessel since she received it.Anything unusual about the goblet? GERALT: Was the order for a normal goblet?OGDEN: Not a chance! It was supposed to be a gift! I ornamented it richly, even on the inside. Not terribly practical, that, as it\\'s hard to get clean, some scum is bound to remain. But I wanted it looking downright regal - worthy of our Saskia.GERALT: The other chalices were not ornamented on the inside?OGDEN: Course not!Any chance that two identical goblets were produced? GERALT: Any chance there could\\'ve been two identical goblets?OGDEN: Why there\\'s no craftsman that comes close to me in Vergen!GERALT: Could someone have tried to copy your handiwork?OGDEN: Hah! I know of one who\\'s been trying for years, but he\\'s a fumbler, a screw up. He\\'s not produced one decent vessel - they all look like the work of a drunken elf. Thorak\\'s his name.[EXIT] Take care. GERALT: See you at the inn, we\\'ll grab a beer.[Geralt talks to the peasants.]PEASANT: Kill!PEASANT: Give us the prince!PEASANT 1: Why is he lingering about? Like the stench in a dwarven hovel...PEASANT 2: Those witchers be cravin\\' gold. This one\\'s sure to say the prince is innocent, then sting Stennis for a pouch.PEASANT 1: He\\'d better search for our lad who served the Virgin instead of pissing around.PEASANT 2: Once done with the prince, he\\'d better take care of the magnates. Throwin\\' their weight about too much, they are.You know this servant? GERALT: You know Saskia\\'s servant?PEASANT 2: Willy of the Oblates. He handled the wine, indeed, but loves the Virgin like a sister and mother put together.PEASANT 1: He\\'d gladly get quartered for her!GERALT: Where\\'s this Willy of yours?PEASANT 2: Hiding in his shack. Afraid of them lords. Squirrels guard \\'im.Did the prince have access to the wine cellar? GERALT: The prince stood right next to Saskia during the council. Did he have access to the wine cellar beforehand?PEASANT 1: How should I know?GERALT: Why flap your mouth, then?PEASANT 2: The prince is a wealthy lord. Bribing a skivvy to poison the wine is nothing to him.GERALT: Just because someone can afford gold teeth doesn\\'t mean they\\'ll pull their healthy ones.What is this really all about? GERALT: What\\'s it really all about? Who\\'s backing you?PEASANT 2: We want justice!PEASANT 1: We don\\'t need no one backing us. We knows what to do.GERALT: How would you punish the prince?PEASANT 2: If a lad counts hens wrong, he\\'ll be flogged. What should we then do with a man poisoning others?PEASANT 3: Kill him!GERALT: A land without a ruler is a nightmare.PEASANT 2: We have a ruler! The Virgin of Aedirn!GERALT: It\\'s not certain she\\'ll live.PEASANT 2: Then we\\'ll choose another who\\'ll manage. But he must be one of us lads. That way he\\'ll understand us.PEASANT 1: And all people is gonna be equal. Our way.GERALT: And the nonhumans?PEASANT 1: We have enough dung on the fields. Let nonhumans find a nonhuman land.PEASANT 2: Away with \\'em![Geralt gets past Stennis\\' guards to talk to Stennis.]GERALT: I want to speak with the prince.GUARD 1: You\\'re unique, then. Everyone else wants to tear him limb from limb.GUARD 2: We won\\'t let you in.[EXIT] Farewell.GERALT: I hope you won\\'t regret that.[AXII] Only I can help the prince. GERALT: Only I can help your prince.[FAILURE] GUARD 1: What are you...? Begone![SUCCESS] GUARD 1: Of course... Why didn\\'t I think of that?GUARD 2: Are you mad?!GUARD 1: Silence! I\\'m in command here and I grant the witcher leave to enter.GUARD 2: Please, master.[Geralt enters the prince\\'s quarters.]STENNIS: Are you here to kill me, monster slayer?GERALT: I\\'m here for your help. You can save Saskia.STENNIS: Do you hear them? They want my head. They equate the words of some village idiot with mine. I am the heir to the Aedirnian throne, the rightful ruler of this land, descendent of Demavend and Virfuril.GERALT: Prince, if you help me heal Saskia, the people will forget...STENNIS: If...? So, if I don\\'t help you, they\\'ll kill me... This is blackmail!GERALT: This is a deal.STENNIS: What do you want?I need blood for a potion. GERALT: I need royal blood for a potion that will heal Saskia.STENNIS: Do you mock me?GERALT: You owe Saskia your life. She carried you away from the wraiths\\' battle.STENNIS: It was her duty - as it would have been of any Aedirnian. Besides, my realm is falling part, and she is responsible. Saskia and her rebels routed the royal forces at Gulet and on the banks of the Dyphne. For practical purposes, the Aedirnian army no longer exists.GERALT: Those rebels are the last hope you have of stopping Henselt.STENNIS: And what then? A pig herd will be crowned and appoint a shoeshine his secretary of state?GERALT: Don\\'t think that far ahead. Your Highness, just a few drops of your blood will cure Saskia. Vergen can defend itself only if she\\'s in command.STENNIS: I\\'ve already said, I owe this girl nothing. I\\'ll not yield to blackmail even if it costs me my life. I\\'ll go to the axe, my head held high. And I\\'ll certainly not surrender even a drop of royal blood to save a peasant girl.Did you poison Saskia? GERALT: Did you poison her?STENNIS: Of course not. Even if I had, do you think I would boast about it? Don\\'t be a fool.GERALT: I\\'m trying to help. Not only Saskia, but you, Your Highness.STENNIS: I won\\'t yield to that rabble! Never! One smear is all they needed to lay siege to my doorstep... Do you really think I should plead my innocence every time some village idiot says, \"The prince did it?\" Or maybe go out there and beg them for mercy? Never!GERALT: You merely need to convince them that you\\'re innocent. Prove it wasn\\'t you, and they\\'ll walk away.STENNIS: And if I am innocent, yet lack proof thereof? You claim you wish to help me... Do so - convince the people to believe me. You\\'ll not regret it.GERALT: You\\'re trying to bribe me.STENNIS: I want only to make a contract. Think about it.STENNIS: Guards!GUARD 1: What is it, Sire?!STENNIS: Show the witcher out.GUARD 2: Is everything in order, Sire?STENNIS: We had a chat, but we are through.STENNIS: Think on what I told you, Geralt.GERALT: I will.[After talking to the dwarves and the peasants, Geralt can leave the Castle of the Three Fathers and follow up on the leads they gave him.]  4.09.01 - THE WALLS HAVE EARS < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to where the Scoia\\'tael are guarding the servant Willy Oblate.]SCOIA\\'TAEL: If it was up to me, I\\'d line them all up against the wall.SCOIA\\'TAEL: Guarding a peasant – some mission that is...SCOIA\\'TAEL: Anyone so much as twitches...WILLY: What should I do...?

I was puttin\\' Saskia\\'s room in order when the priest came to the prince\\'s chamber next door. They wasn\\'t speakin\\' loud, but I heard the priest say, \"Just clear the servants from the kitchen.\" Nothing more. Reverend Olcan - only he could tell you how it was, beginning to end.GERALT: The dead aren\\'t very talkative.WILLY: What about what they leave behind? There may be clues or some such...GERALT: Maybe...[AXII] Know anything about the assassination attempt? GERALT: Tell me everything you know about the attempt on Saskia\\'s life.[FAILURE] WILLY: What?

Simple - let me show you on the map. It\\'s about right here.[Geralt enters the priest\\'s room to search it.]GERALT: Strange aura...[On Olcan\\'s desk, Geralt finds a schematic for a goblet similar to the one Saskia used.]  4.09.01 - SUSPECT: THORAK (BALTIMORE\\'S NIGHTMARE) < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to find Thorak.]THORAK: Welcome, witcher, to my humble home.GERALT: I have a few questions.THORAK: Ask away.Did you make Saskia\\'s goblet? GERALT: Anyone order an exquisitely adorned goblet from you?THORAK: I get the occasional commission for tableware, sure. But what exactly are you talking about?GERALT: Saskia\\'s goblet. Was that your handiwork?THORAK: That ugly bucket? Did you intend to offend me? Whoever made that thing should be whipped. I certainly hope Saskia orders her vessels from me next time.GERALT: If she gets a chance to order anything again.[Geralt notices that a nearby door resembles the one he saw in the dream of the terrified dwarf Baltimore and asks Thorak about it.]GERALT: I\\'m looking for a dwarf by the name of Baltimore. Does he live here?THORAK: Master Baltimore vanished some time ago.Who was Master Baltimore? GERALT: Who was Master Baltimore?THORAK: He was our runesmith. The greatest specialist the world has ever seen. A lot of water has flowed down the Pontar since he disappeared, yet me and my apprentices still can\\'t recreate all the runes he could inscribe.How did Baltimore vanish? GERALT: How did he vanish?THORAK: One day he just up and disappeared. He had his fears, even paranoia, but that comes natural with great artists... Thought someone was out to kill him, then he vanished \\'thout a trace in mysterious circumstances. After a month long search, we held a funeral - without his body - to honor the memory of the great master.GERALT: Is that all?THORAK: Baltimore\\'s best apprentice became the new runesmith and... life goes on.Who lives here now? GERALT: Who lives here now?THORAK: Yours truly. As Baltimore\\'s best apprentice, I became the new runesmith. Got this house, along with the honor of continuing the great master\\'s work.GERALT: Can you tell me something about that mouldy door?THORAK: That\\'s the entrance to Baltimore\\'s old workshop.GERALT: Mind if I take a look?THORAK: Not at all. Only, ye won\\'t find anything but scrap metal and cobwebs.[Inside the workshop, Geralt brings down a wall using Aard and finds a key and some notes with directions from Baltimore.]THORAK: I heard a rumble, witcher... Everything all right?GERALT: Yeah, just some rubble.THORAK: Find anything?Yeah. GERALT: I found this...THORAK: I can\\'t read it. That\\'s Elder speech, right?GERALT: Correct. The text describes how to get to a certain place.THORAK: What place?GERALT: Don\\'t know. The clues mark out a route of some sort.THORAK: Could be where Baltimore hid his notes! Please, come to me if ye find anything. It\\'s very important.Nothing interesting. GERALT: Not a thing.THORAK: Poor Baltimore lost his mind before his death and must have destroyed all his notes.GERALT: Why are you so sure he\\'s dead? You didn\\'t find a body. Maybe he just... departed.THORAK: Well... If he departed, he\\'s as good as dead to us. A decent dwarf don\\'t leave his settlement. Tell me... why are ye so interested in Baltimore?Not your concern. GERALT: That\\'s my business.THORAK: Ye\\'re wrong. Everything about a master\\'s heritage is his successor\\'s concern, which means it\\'s my business. Baltimore\\'s legacy belongs to us dwarves, so we\\'ll be keeping an eye on ye.Just curious. GERALT: Curiosity, nothing more.THORAK: Curiosity can be dangerous. It\\'s led many a man astray.GERALT: Are you threatening me?THORAK: On the contrary... It\\'s more of a warning. See ya.[Geralt follows Baltimore\\'s notes to his secret workshop. Once he finds it, Thorak and two thugs arrive.][If Geralt showed Thorak the notes] THORAK: Witcher, wait!GERALT: What are you doing here?THORAK: I been shadowing ye since the first time ye asked about Baltimore.GERALT: Don\\'t you mean \"we\"?THORAK: Pay them no heed, they\\'re my apprentices. I\\'ve an offer for ye. Before you explore that chest, allow my apprentice to take Baltimore\\'s notes. The rest is yours.Wanna keep your head? GERALT: And I have an offer for you. Get out of here or I\\'ll cut your head off.THORAK: I knew kindness would lead nowhere. Get him, lads![The dwarves attack.]Why do you care about those notes so much? GERALT: What\\'s in those notes that you care about them so much? Why can\\'t I see them?THORAK: Baltimore was quirky in his old days. The chest may contain documents disgracing people who hold important posts in Vergen. I can\\'t allow anyone to read them. Even if they\\'re the creation of a sick mind. That\\'s why, as I said, ye\\'ll let us search the chest before you do. We\\'ll take the notes, ye\\'ll likely get a pouch full of orens - as well as a discount in my rune shop for life.Agreed. GERALT: So be it.THORAK: Gamp, search the chest.THORAK: Wise choice, witcher. If you need any runes, come see me. I never forget a favor.I don\\'t like shady deals. [Same as \"Wanna keep your head?\"][If Geralt didn\\'t show Thorak the notes] THORAK: I knew you were hiding something from me, witcher.GERALT: I wasn\\'t the only one to hide something. Baltimore\\'s notes state that the master will return from the grave to meet with you.THORAK: Nobody returns from where we sent him.GERALT: You just admitted to murder.THORAK: Aye - but what of it? No one besides you knows, and you\\'ll not leave here alive. Get him, lads![If Geralt kills Thorak, he loots a key off of him and goes to report the crime to Cecil.]CECIL: By the pricks of the male gods! Master Baltimore\\'s notes! Where did you get them?!GERALT: I discovered his vault near the trolls\\' lair. By the way... Thorak, your new rune master, is dead. He and his two apprentices have left for a better world.CECIL: What?! How did it happen?GERALT: Thorak murdered Baltimore. There\\'s enough evidence in the notes I just gave you.CECIL: Thanks, witcher. A reward for your labors. It\\'s not much, but I\\'ll be needing funds to appoint and equip a new rune master now.[With Thorak dead, Geralt can use his key to unlock a box in his workshop and find a receipt from Reverend Olcan ordering the duplicate goblet.][Geralt returns to the Castle and finds things escalating rapidly.]NOBLE 1: If not for that damned Iorveth, the serfs would probably be hanging the prince by now.NOBLE 2: He cannot be trusted. If he found proof of Stennis\\'s guilt, he\\'d point his bow the other way.NOBLE 1: But if it wasn\\'t for him, we could not defend the prince.NOBLE 1: Who will the witcher side with?NOBLE 2: He\\'s on very good terms with that damned elf.NOBLE 1: Maybe he has good intentions? After all, he defended the prince.KALTEN: Enough of this charade!SKALEN: Try to be reasonable, folks! Sit down and talk in peace!KALTEN: We\\'ve talked enough! Come on lads, let\\'s drag the prince from \\'is hovel!GERALT: Vergen\\'s not a cesspit for anyone to shit in. There are laws to abide and Skalen Burdon\\'s job is to uphold them.SILGRAT: There\\'s no law allowing a serf to threaten a king\\'s scion! I, Silgrat, brother of Seltkirk, the greatest knight to walk Aedirnian land, say so!GERALT: Does it matter who was born in a castle and who in a pigsty!? Any fool can prejudge and condemn. It\\'s easier to accuse than to prove guilt.SILGRAT: A peasant servant claims that Prince Stennis supposedly attempted to kill Saskia. Why would the prince do such a dastardly deed?! Bear in mind how eminent is his lineage!KALTEN: That\\'s why! The mongrel covets the crown!SILGRAT: Do you even remember how valorous he was towards Saskia during the negotiations with Henselt?!KALTEN: Pretending to be with her he was, sly fox! Taking the simple peasants in! But us lads ain\\'t so dumb as you lords think!SILGRAT: See for yourselves how the commoners hate the prince, spitting venom like adders! They hatched a plot to dispose of him.PEASANT: Saskia\\'s servant said that...SILGRAT: Where is this servant, might I ask? If he\\'s got something to say, why does he hide like a thief?! The answer is simple - he\\'s a fraud!KALTEN: He\\'s hidin\\' to save his skin from you whoresons! Squirrels have to guard him!SILGRAT: One last question: how could the prince poison Saskia? It\\'s a known fact that servants taste wine from the barrels before the Virgin sips it!GERALT: No need to poison the wine. Smearing the poison inside the chalice would be enough.SILGRAT: I never heard of anyone poisoning a chalice.GERALT: You haven\\'t heard much, then. One of the emperor\\'s forebears died after sampling some lamb. He was always scared of poison and ate supper with his cook. The murderer spread poison on one side of a knife. Then he cut the meat so that only a small piece was poisoned.KALTEN: The witcher\\'s right! Give us Stennis!SILGRAT: Saskia\\'s got her own chalice!GERALT: It was commissioned from one of the dwarves. The order came with a very detailed drawing.SILGRAT: Even so - how did it come into Saskia\\'s hand?Good question. GERALT: A good point. We can\\'t be sure if the prince poisoned the wine.I\\'m not convinced. GERALT: It\\'s not clear how the prince poisoned the wine, but that doesn\\'t mean he didn\\'t do it.KALTEN: Stennis is blowing hot and cold. Everyone knows that!SILGRAT: You were supposed to prove his guilt, not insult him, yokel!KALTEN: Tell us who else would do it?! A peasant wanting to hurt the miss? Never! It\\'s \\'cause of her you noble dogs can\\'t ignore us! A pig won\\'t cut it\\'s own throat. A peasant\\'s not foolish enough to raise his hand against his savior!SILGRAT: Perhaps it is no peasant\\'s deed. However, that doesn\\'t mean the prince is guilty, fool.KALTEN: Answer me this: was not Stennis\\'s room next to Saskia\\'s? Do not the wines come from his own lice-ridden cellar? Can he not enter the Virgin\\'s kitchen at will?! Yes, his serene dumbhead the prince can, curses on his kin! Nobody in Vergen wants to kill Saskia! And even if they wanted, nobody but Stennis could do it.GERALT: You\\'re wrong, Kalten. Reverend Olcan wanted to get rid of Saskia. He thought she was a monster at heart.KALTEN: Olcan was on Stennis\\' leash, like a dog.SILGRAT: How dare you, lout! Do you imagine if someone sits next to a married lady he\\'s surely fucking her?GERALT: The priest tried to convince Prince Stennis to join the conspiracy.KALTEN: Is Stennis some dimwit foundling that he dances to a lousy priest\\'s tune?! Olcan got what he deserved when Henselt cleaved his head. Now it\\'s Stennis\\'s time!SILGRAT: There is no proof the prince agreed!GERALT: The priest asked him for admittance to the kitchen.KALTEN: So he didn\\'t poison the Virgin himself, but allowed her to be poisoned.That makes sense. GERALT: It appears Stennis would benefit the most from Saskia\\'s death.That\\'s guesswork, not evidence. GERALT: Those are just words. Too much guesswork and not enough evidence. You can\\'t convict anyone based on that.[Stennis emerges from his rooms to confront the mob.]SILGRAT: Your Highness... This is dangerous...STENNIS: I am not afraid. Fear is a commoner\\'s trait, unfit for one with royal blood running in his veins. What do you want? To judge me? Is a prince a common thief who steals a dozen eggs at the market?STENNIS: You stand before royal majesty! And you raise your hands against it! In this world there are crimes that can be forgiven! And crimes that, by any means, cannot! Just as a mother killing her own child or a man slitting his own brother\\'s throat cannot be forgiven... A crime against one anointed by the gods themselves also cannot be condoned! He who raises hand against divine right is not worthy to walk this world.KALTEN: And what about he who poisons the Virgin of Aedirn?STENNIS: Firstly, Saskia is alive, so no one can blame me for her death. Secondly, you have no proof that it was I who tried to murder her! And thirdly, I assure all gathered here, I won\\'t rise above the law. However, only she, the Virgin of Aedirn, can judge me.KALTEN: Canny! And if Saskia won\\'t get well, who\\'s gonna judge you?STENNIS: I believe she can be cured. But if the gods decide otherwise, we\\'ll summon a coven of the wise who can pass just sentence.SILGRAT: Those are words worthy of a true sovereign!STENNIS: I am the one you should look to for guidance. Let my deeds be the flame that lights up your darkness.GERALT: So you\\'ve forgotten how you tried to bribe me when I was at your house?KALTEN: How about that, snout-face?!SILGRAT: This is slander!STENNIS: There are no witnesses, witcher.The prince is guilty. GERALT: You didn\\'t say a word about your guilt or innocence. You demand justice, you want to summon a coven of the wise. But who will sit on that coven? Any peasants? No, only people you\\'ll nominate yourself. Lords whom you\\'ll reward with lands for reaching the right decision? Such men are to decide if you\\'re guilty? No. You are guilty, Prince. You know you are.A lynching would be a bad idea. GERALT: The prince has a right to a fair trial, no matter if he\\'s guilty or not. We can\\'t deny him that.GERALT: What will the peasants do if we hand them the prince? Will they hear him out? No. They\\'ll hang him from the nearest tree, or tear him limb from limb.GERALT: What will happen if we allow a lynching? What if people see that might makes right? Who\\'ll guarantee they won\\'t desire to avenge their wrongs? Real and imagined... Who\\'ll protect people whose only fault is noble birth from the exasperated mob? And where will it lead...?[If Geralt advocates for a trial, two dwarves take Stennis away to prison; otherwise, the peasant mob beats him to death on the spot and Geralt collects a vial of royal blood from his corpse.][If Stennis lives] IORVETH: The peasants are furious.GERALT: They didn\\'t dare mount a frontal attack.IORVETH: But they haven\\'t forgotten about Stennis. And won\\'t. It\\'ll be that way until Saskia regains consciousness.GERALT: She won\\'t keep order by strength alone.IORVETH: Unless it\\'s a great strength.GERALT: We need an authority figure. And royal blood.IORVETH: Five quarts go to waste in the dwarven dungeon at the moment.GERALT: There\\'s also Henselt.IORVETH: Going into that haunted mist is madness. Stealing Stennis away would be easier.GERALT: No. Anything involving Stennis will cause a riot.IORVETH: I\\'ve had enough of the peasants and nobles barking. Saskia\\'s the best leader I know, but she can\\'t hope to defeat Henselt\\'s army with this rabble. Which is why I\\'m going to get reinforcements.GERALT: Where?IORVETH: Four Scoia\\'tael units await in hiding to the east. Time to summon them.GERALT: You\\'ll make it in time?IORVETH: I must.[If Stennis dies] GERALT: The nobles won\\'t forgive them that.IORVETH: They\\'re a cowardly lot. Yelping\\'s all they\\'re good at.GERALT: And backstabbing.IORVETH: By Stennis\\'s example. His filthy life wasn\\'t taken in vain - Eilhart will get royal blood, and Saskia will be cured.GERALT: We need to hurry, we can\\'t keep peace in Vergen with strength alone.IORVETH: Anything\\'s possible using strength. One just has to know how to use it.GERALT: That\\'s your credo?IORVETH: Saskia\\'s the best leader I know, but she can\\'t hope to defeat Henselt with this rabble.GERALT: What do you intend to do?IORVETH: I\\'ll get reinforcements. The Scoia\\'tael are more numerous than you think. Time to summon them. I\\'ll leave shortly.GERALT: You won\\'t get through the fog.IORVETH: I don\\'t intend to. Mountains may stop human armies, but not the Scoia\\'tael. I\\'m going south.GERALT: Will you be back in time?IORVETH: I have to. Va fail, Gwynbleidd. Don\\'t lose hope.[Geralt can have a conversation with Stennis in prison where he further discusses the crime (possibly unimplemented.)]STENNIS: Have you come to humiliate me further?GERALT: Give it a rest. Your feelings aren\\'t exactly my biggest problem right now.STENNIS: We\\'ve nothing more to discuss, witcher.What did you hope to achieve, Stennis? GERALT: I think I understand why you poisoned her. There\\'s just one thing that still doesn\\'t make sense.GERALT: What did you really want to achieve? You know you couldn\\'t take Saskia\\'s place. These people would never follow you.STENNIS: I\\'m next in line for the throne. My blood is royal blood.GERALT: That\\'s not enough. Though you\\'ve always sought it, you never actually gained recognition. None respected you - not your father, not the great families, not your subjects.GERALT: You\\'ve hated Saskia since you first set eyes on her, because people loved her. That hurt more than all the other claims to the throne combined.STENNIS: I trust you are nearing some conclusion?GERALT: Mhm. I actually came here to thank you. You\\'ve made me realize something important.GERALT: I\\'ve been wondering why the kingslayers murdered your father, yet didn\\'t come after you. They didn\\'t need to - it was evident you\\'d either never be crowned or bring about your own downfall. Someone sent those killers. Someone who knows you very well and knows people in general. That information is in itself priceless.[EXIT] Godspeed. GERALT: This is where our paths diverge, Stennis. Farewell.STENNIS: Get out.  4.10 - WHERE IS TRISS MERIGOLD: ACROSS THE MISTS < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[After dealing with Stennis, Geralt returns to Philippa to see what she found out about the bandana. He stops at her door and again hears moaning; he chuckles to himself and opens the door. This time, Cynthia is on all fours on the bed as Philippa uses a riding crop. They stop as Geralt comes in.]PHILIPPA: I tried locating Triss, but the mist disrupts the megascope. There\\'s a weak signal nearby. Probably on the other side...GERALT: In the Kaedweni camp?PHILIPPA: You\\'ll have to pass through the mist.Entering the mist is suicide. GERALT: The mist is full of wraiths.PHILIPPA: I\\'ll help you.I\\'ll go then. GERALT: There\\'s no time to lose.PHILIPPA: I\\'m continuously scanning the battlefield, I\\'ll show you the way through. I\\'ll find you when you enter the mist.GERALT: Farewell, then.[If Stennis is alive] PHILIPPA: We still need royal blood...GERALT: I know - Henselt.PHILIPPA: We need his blood, not his death.GERALT: How many times do I have to tell you? I\\'m not a kingslayer.[Geralt enters the mists from the Vergeni side. The owl swoops down from above.]PHILIPPA: You\\'re finally here. Ready?Let\\'s go. GERALT: As I\\'ll ever be. Let\\'s go.PHILIPPA: We\\'ll speak when we get there. I shall cover you, but you must nevertheless be vigilant.[Geralt and Philippa traverse the battlefield the same way they did when the curse arose, with Philippa providing a magical shield. They exit the mist on the Kaedweni side and she transforms back into her human form.]PHILIPPA: I can go no further. If Dethmold senses my presence...GERALT: How will I get back to Vergen?PHILIPPA: I\\'ll wait nearby. Hurry![Geralt heads towards Henselt\\'s fortress. Still some distance away, he finds a corpse, which he crouches to examine. He finds a strange, Nilfgaardian-style figurine on the body, which he pockets. He stands up to see Vernon Roche and a Blue Stripe approaching him.]ROCHE: I knew it... Damn! I knew it was you. When the mist started whirling, I told the boys - it\\'s Geralt of Rivia or my name isn\\'t Vernon Roche.ROCHE: Friend of yours?GERALT: Just found him. He was already dead.ROCHE: Interesting. Dressed like a Vergeni... He almost made it through the fog. What\\'s your business here?None of yours. GERALT: None of yours, Roche.ROCHE: Is that so? When the Kaedweni realise you came from Vergen they\\'ll cut you into shreds.GERALT: Triss is somewhere nearby.Saskia will die without my help. GERALT: Saskia\\'s been poisoned. The antidote can\\'t be made without a rose of remembrance. I came here to get one.ROCHE: Dogs are at each others\\' throats even though a bear tests their bounds? No roses bloom here, Geralt. Tell the truth.GERALT: I gave such a rose to Triss.ROCHE: Still looking for your sorceress? If she came here I\\'d know about it.Philippa says otherwise. GERALT: She\\'s got to be here. Philippa Eilhart located her.ROCHE: It seems you met the whole menagerie. Will you abandon them, too, when things get hot?Stop lying, Roche. GERALT: In that case, you either know nothing, or you\\'re lying.ROCHE: Plough yourself, son of a bitch. I owe you nothing.Help me. GERALT: Roche, it\\'s really important. Only you can help me.ROCHE: Now you want my help? I\\'ll gladly return the favour... Oh, wait, you did nothing for me!ROCHE: You made your choice. Fled with the elves, while Ves almost died at that whoreson Loredo\\'s house!What happened there? GERALT: Is Ves all right?ROCHE: What do you care? We could\\'ve all died while you played at being a Squirrel.I promised you nothing. GERALT: I\\'m not one of your men, Roche. I didn\\'t betray you.ROCHE: I didn\\'t say that.GERALT: But you thought it. You and your men against the whole world. Those not on your side are against you.I\\'m not about to explain myself to you. GERALT: I refuse to explain myself – to you or anyone else.ROCHE: You saved a group of thieves and bandits!GERALT: Deride them if you will, but they\\'re ready to die side by side with the simple people of Vergen. They\\'ve got better reasons to fight than orders.ROCHE: Don\\'t you care about Foltest\\'s death any more?GERALT: The assassin kidnapped Triss, remember? Help me find her and I promise I\\'ll keep the word I gave you in the dungeons of La Valette Castle.ROCHE: Argh. I don\\'t know why I\\'m doing this.ROCHE: Right, if Triss is anywhere in the area, it can only be one place. At the rear, near the riverbank, the Nilfgaardians have set up their camp. Nobody can enter it.ROCHE: You can get there either via some caves or by sneaking through the main camp. I\\'d forget the gates... Believe it or not, the whorehouse is where you need to go to enter the caves. The ladies thought they\\'d use that passage to service the knights and nobles, but some monsters have their lairs there.ROCHE: If you\\'ve had your fill of whores and monsters, to the east there\\'s a path that leads along the riverbank. That\\'ll get you near the canteen. You\\'ll have to sneak the rest of the way from there.GERALT: Thanks, Roche.ROCHE: Hey! I\\'ll hold you to your promise![Roche and his man leave. Geralt can either sneak through the camp as Roche suggests, or ask the brothel madame, Carole, about the cave passageway.]CAROLE: Well, well, a witcher. Girls, prim yourselves! How can I help you, handsome?GERALT: I wanted to talk.CAROLE: We\\'re no strangers to the art of conversation, but it\\'ll cost you just as much as a good plough.GERALT: Sounds all right.CAROLE: Ask away, then. What would you like to talk about?I need to get inside the camp. Unnoticed. CAROLE: That\\'ll cost you more than straight ploughing.I\\'ll pay you. [NOT ENOUGH COIN] CAROLE: That\\'s nowhere near enough.[SUCCESS] CAROLE: Hmmm, that seems satisfactory. We\\'ve an underground passageway leading out to the riverbank within the camp\\'s confines.GERALT: Thanks.CAROLE: Although we\\'ve not used it for some time. There\\'s something down there, something evil, horrible.GERALT: I\\'m sure I\\'ll manage.CAROLE: The entrance is inside the tent.[If Geralt goes through the caves, it turns out the evil presence is a pack of rotfiends and bullvores. Either way, he arrives at the Nilfgaardian camp, where he\\'s stopped by a guard.]GUARD: Evgyr, Nordling! Where do you think you\\'re going?GERALT: To see the ambassador.GUARD: With all that steel on your back?I\\'m looking for a redhaired sorceress. GERALT: Have you seen a redheaded sorceress anywhere?GUARD: You didn\\'t seem to understand my delicate suggestion, Nordling. Drop your sword.[AXII] I\\'ve come for Triss Merigold. GERALT: I\\'m here for Triss Merigold.[FAILURE] GUARD: Drop your sword, warlock. Now![SUCCESS] GUARD: Triss Merigold? The ambassador says she\\'s not arrived yet.I\\'ll go unarmed. GERALT: I\\'m not looking for trouble.GUARD: Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen is waiting.[The guard brings Geralt to Shilard\\'s tent.]SHILARD: Met nare ravnewaart, hetmel.SHILARD: Geralt! I\\'d hoped we wouldn\\'t meet again.GUARD 1: We caught him sneaking through the camp, Excellency. We disarmed him.GUARD 2: Ester garemnyth.[If Geralt used Axii] GUARD 1: He tried a charm on us.SHILARD: I remember you telling Foltest you\\'d like to return to hunting monsters.I\\'m looking for Triss. GERALT: Triss Merigold was kidnapped.SHILARD: Foltest\\'s advisor? I heard she arrived at Vergen and hoped we would meet, but if she was kidnapped... Now I understand why you couldn\\'t just stand by. But there are other reasons, too.The king\\'s death changed a lot. GERALT: Foltest is dead. Some still believe it\\'s my fault. I have to find the real killer.SHILARD: I see. You may be a killing machine, but a murderer\\'s infamy is bad for business.It\\'s not like that. GERALT: It\\'s not like that. Now it\\'s personal.SHILARD: Ah! Of course, that changes things. It seems, however, that something more is at stake.Why are you so interested in me? GERALT: Why are you so interested in me?SHILARD: They told me you were in league with the Scoia\\'tael. With Iorveth himself, no less... Is this true?GERALT: More or less.SHILARD: Have you heard of the slaughter of Aen Seidhe at the Ravine of the Hydra? The kings of the North effectively forced the Empire to condemn and execute the war criminals of the Vrihedd Brigade. Iorveth was among those condemned.[Geralt slips into a flashback. GERALT, NARRATING: September 13, 1269 – The Ravine of the Hydra. Following the Peace of Cintra, 53 officers of the Vrihedd Brigade were brought here and executed, their throats cut. The elves’ bodies were dropped into the chasm. I don’t know what the riders of the Hunt were looking for.\\xa0November 23, 1269 – Cintra, the village of Coldwater, and another victim of the Hunt – an eleven-year-old boy. His parents didn’t even ask if he had a chance. I\\'m tired.\\xa0February 24, 1270 – A high pass in the Armush Mountains. An imperial manticore – one of the world’s oldest and deadliest monsters. I used to feel excitement at moments like this, now the beast is only an obstacle on my way. Its meat and hot blood will help me survive this icy hell.\\xa0May 30, 1270 – The Yaruga River. The Hunt continues to race south. Since I’ve been following them, they’ve taken 23 individuals. All between the ages of ten and twenty. All except for Yennefer.]SHILARD: Amusing that the Scoia\\'tael believe the Emperor betrayed them. In fact, the kings of the North demanded the massacre at the Ravine of the Hydra. Do you feel well?GERALT: I feel fine.SHILARD: I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t give you more of my time. The long road to Loc Muinne awaits me. The Council and the Conclave are waiting, and Triss Merigold, as always, arrives in the nick of time.GERALT: What are you talking about?SHILARD: The figurine. He must have it on him.[The guards grab Geralt and tie his hands behind his back.]GERALT: What\\'s the meaning of this?!SHILARD: I want to introduce someone to you. This is Vanhemar, my personal sorcerer. He sensed Triss approaching our camp, though she was to arrive in different company.[The Nilfgaardians find the figurine on Geralt and give it to Shilard. He smashes it to reveal a tiny figure of Triss inside.]SHILARD: Before you die, witcher... Would you be so kind as to explain how you got your hands on this figurine?I found it. GERALT: I found it on a man\\'s corpse.SHILARD: And you finished his mission. For the Emperor\\'s glory.What did you do to her? GERALT: Triss! What have you done to her?SHILARD: She\\'ll be all right, Geralt. She can\\'t hear, see or feel, but she is alive.You\\'ll pay for this. GERALT: If you hurt her, I\\'ll find you. Even in Nilfgaard.SHILARD: Triss will help us find those wenches that betrayed the Empire. I don\\'t know whether you killed Tarvik or found him dead. It\\'s irrelevant now.SHILARD: I\\'d prefer not to sentence to death a man previously pardoned by the Emperor himself. Unfortunately, I have no choice.SHILARD: Vanhemar, once you\\'re done with him, convey my congratulations to Cynthia. Leading Philippa Eilhart up the garden path is no small feat.SHILARD: Farewell, witcher.[Geralt watches the Nilfgaardians depart in their ship. Vanhemar and a guard stand over him.]VANHEMAR: This is a good place. Are you ready, Geralt of Rivia?GERALT: I am.VANHEMAR: I\\'d prefer to face you in combat, but that cannot be arranged.GERALT: Plough yourself, Nilfgaardian.VANHEMAR: Your words mean nothing now.[Vanhemar raises Geralt\\'s steel sword, preparing to execute him, when the guard behind him falls to a crossbow bolt. Geralt looks up to see Ves and Roche fighting Nilfgaardians; he headbutts the mage, knocking him over, and incapacitates him with a kick to the face. Roche comes and cuts him loose; the three of them kill the Nilfgaardians remaining in the camp.]ROCHE: Just like the good old days... Haven\\'t killed a Nilfgaardian for years! I knew you\\'d get in trouble.Lucky I can always count on you. GERALT: You\\'ve a talent for getting me out of it.GERALT: Shilard has Triss. He\\'s taking her to Loc Muinne.ROCHE: Now I understand the commotion. Ambassador Shilard kidnaps Foltest\\'s former advisor... This stinks horribly, Geralt. It would seem the Nilfgaardians want to be present at the Conclave\\'s restoration.What\\'s going to happen in Loc Muinne? GERALT: What will happen at Loc Muinne?ROCHE: Apparently, a lot more than I thought.I\\'m going there, too. GERALT: Destination Loc Muinne, then.ROCHE: I should have known.Triss is key to finding the kingslayer. GERALT: Only Triss can lead us to the kingslayer. I need to save her.ROCHE: Not only her, Geralt... All the other leads point to the same place.ROCHE: Sile managed to locate the killers\\' hideout. They were hiding nearby, in the gullies. Dethmold sent his men there, but Foltest\\'s killer fled. Two other witchers were covering him. One was taken alive. Before he died from torture, he revealed that our bruiser went to Loc Muinne.ROCHE: The mages want to resurrect the Council and the Conclave that once represented all the sorcerers and sorceresses of the North.ROCHE: King Radovid, the ruler of Redania, is also invited. As Loc Muinne lies in Kaedwen, Henselt is likely to arrive, too. But a Nilfgaardian delegation...?ROCHE: Triss, Nilfgaard, Radovid, a bunch of mages and the kingslayer... too many eggs in that basket.GERALT: One more thing, Roche.[The paths diverge here depending on whether Stennis is alive or dead.][If Stennis is alive] GERALT: I need to see Henselt.ROCHE: Why?Saskia will die without his blood. GERALT: I need a few drops of Henselt\\'s blood. Someone poisoned Saskia\\'s wine, and his blood is an ingredient of the cure.ROCHE: Saskia\\'s a rebel, a wench from who knows where. She only speaks of knightly honour...GERALT: Says Vernon Roche, blue-blooded prince, heir of Temeria...ROCHE: All right... enough. Ah, plough it![PERSUASION] Think I might want to kill him? GERALT: You think I want to kill him?[FAILURE] ROCHE: I think you should be honest with me.[Continues the same as \"Saskia will die without his blood.\"][SUCCESS] ROCHE: If I thought you were a kingslayer, you\\'d be dead.ROCHE: I hope I won\\'t regret it. Henselt should be in his tent. I\\'ll distract the guards, then it\\'s up to you.GERALT: I owe you, Vernon.ROCHE: That\\'s not even funny anymore, Geralt.ROCHE: So, ready?GERALT: Let\\'s go, Roche.[Geralt and Roche approach the first set of guards; Geralt hides behind a bunch of crates.]ROCHE: Hey, you! Come over here!GUARD: What do you want, Temerian?ROCHE: Those Nilfgaardians are beating up our lads!GUARD: What? Whoresons will regret that![Geralt sneaks around to the back of the royal tent; he uses Aard on a stack of barrels to distract the guards in front.]GUARD 1: What the devil happened here?GUARD 2: Henselt will skin us alive![Geralt gets into Henselt\\'s tent and sneaks up behind the king, putting his sword to his neck.]HENSELT: Who are...? Have you come to kill me?I\\'m considering it. GERALT: Since I\\'m here, perhaps I should think about it.HENSELT: You wouldn\\'t dare.GERALT: I\\'m here for your blood.HENSELT: You sneak in here like a villain and you want my blood? Fight me and try to spill it.GERALT: Calm down, Your Highness. I need only a drop.HENSELT: Who are you?Geralt of Rivia. GERALT: Geralt of Rivia.HENSELT: Foltest\\'s favourite witcher, I\\'ve heard of you.It doesn\\'t matter. GERALT: Someone holding a sword to your throat, Your Highness.HENSELT: Why do you need my blood?To make an antidote for Saskia. GERALT: Saskia, the Virgin of Aedirn, was poisoned. Royal blood is one of the antidote\\'s ingredients.HENSELT: What superstitious nonsense! The wench wants royal blood? She should bite Stennis, Aedirn\\'s heir, in the arse!None of your business. GERALT: That, Sire, doesn\\'t concern you. My hand is numb, so I could end up with an excess of your blood.HENSELT: If you kill me, you won\\'t leave the camp alive.GERALT: Listen, Your Highness. Give me your blood voluntarily, or I\\'ll open your veins myself. I prefer the first choice - it would work out better for both of us. If I spill your blood myself, I\\'ll have to break through the entire camp again. Who knows, maybe one of your soldiers will get lucky and kill me.HENSELT: I sincerely hope so, satchel-mouth!GERALT: But then, the wraiths\\' mist will hang on the border until your knights become weary of warring.HENSELT: What are you talking about? You know how to open the way for my army?GERALT: Yes, but I can\\'t do it dead.HENSELT: You\\'ll get my blood... But promise you\\'ll disperse the mist.GERALT: You have my word, King.[Geralt lets Henselt go, and the king slits his own palm and provides Geralt a small bottle of his blood.]HENSELT: Remember our deal.HENSELT: My men will lead you out of the camp. I wouldn\\'t want one of the soldiers to \"get lucky.\"HENSELT: Tell me though - how did you pass the mist?GERALT: I\\'m a witcher.HENSELT: Then I need an army of ploughing witchers.[Henselt\\'s guards escort Geralt to the border of the camp.][If Stennis is dead] GERALT: I have to go back to Vergen. Philippa may know something more about Triss.ROCHE: It won\\'t be easy. The camp\\'s in uproar. I bet you mauled somebody while breaking through to Shilard.GERALT: Could be.ROCHE: Right. We\\'ll pretend you\\'re my prisoner. I\\'ll get you out of here, but remember - our goal is Foltest\\'s killer.GERALT: I\\'ll remember, Roche.ROCHE: So, ready?GERALT: Let\\'s go, Roche.[Geralt and Roche head into the main part of the camp with Geralt\\'s hands tied.]GERALT: I\\'m not sure it\\'ll work...ROCHE: If we just avoid the officers.[They are stopped at the gate of the camp.]SOLDIER: Who goes there?!ROCHE: Vernon Roche, I\\'ve got a prisoner.SOLDIER: What kind of freak is he?ROCHE: The King ordered him questioned. Outside the camp.SOLDIER: Outside, eh? Ha-ha... Don\\'t let me keep you, then.ROCHE: We should be safe here.GERALT: Thanks for everything, Vernon. I owe you.ROCHE: You never ceased to owe me. Remember my proposal...[Roche heads back towards the Blue Stripes\\' camp.][Geralt returns to where Philippa is waiting.]PHILIPPA: Finally, you\\'re back! Where is Triss?GERALT: The Nilfgaardians have taken her to Loc Muinne.PHILIPPA: What?GERALT: They cast a spell on her. Turned her into a figurine.PHILIPPA: Artifact compression. They must have a powerful mage.GERALT: They had.PHILIPPA: Without him, Shilard won\\'t be able to lift the spell. However, Loc Muinne will be full of sorcerers...GERALT: That\\'s not all. They got Triss because of Cynthia.PHILIPPA: Cynthia?GERALT: She lied to you.PHILIPPA: Back to Vergen. At once.[Geralt and Philippa cross the mists again. He meets her in her quarters in Vergen; she is furious.]PHILIPPA: The plague! I was so foolish! Cherish this rare moment, witcher. Philippa Eilhart\\'s been had by a cheap Nilfgaardian bitch! When I find her we\\'ll have it out like never before. She\\'ll regret her mother didn\\'t abort her.GERALT: Wait! The rose of remembrance is gone.PHILIPPA: Not necessarily. That viper, Cynthia, was in a hurry and left her bric-a-brac... Ah, yes, here it is - Triss Merigold\\'s rose of remembrance. Time is running out, Geralt. This flower is dying.GERALT: Then what are we waiting for?  4.11 - A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt gives Philippa all the ingredients she asked for.]GERALT: Your turn, sorceress. I have all you need to cure Saskia.PHILIPPA: Let\\'s get to work.[Geralt and Philippa go to Saskia\\'s house, where the Scoia\\'tael have been guarding her.]PHILIPPA: Scoia\\'tael, stand aside.[Inside Saskia\\'s quarters, Philippa administers a glowing blue potion to the unconscious woman, then injects her with a hypodermic before casting a spell. Geralt, a dwarf, and the two Scoia\\'tael guards look on. Finally, Philippa kisses Saskia with a petal from the rose held between her lips.]DWARF: My favorite type of magic – Lesbomancy.[Philippa steps away, and Saskia sits up.]PHILIPPA: What is your name?SASKIA: Saesenthe...PHILIPPA: What do they call you?SASKIA: Saskia...PHILIPPA: Do you remember what happened?SASKIA: Poison. They poisoned me... What day is it? What of the battle? Henselt and his army?PHILIPPA: Calm yourself, you will have your battle yet. I shall go and announce that you\\'re once again among the living.SASKIA: Do I owe you my life?GERALT: And Philippa.SASKIA: Thank you, Geralt. I promise to return the favor. Have you succeeded in lifting the curse?GERALT: No, but we\\'re almost ready to try. Vandergrift\\'s sword – it\\'s one of the conveyors of the Power...SASKIA: You should have taken it. It\\'s scrap iron to me – a sword like any other.GERALT: The Scoia\\'tael wouldn\\'t let anyone but Philippa near you. And they wouldn\\'t have let even her take your famous sword. I\\'ll try to remove the curse soon.SASKIA: Why do you aid me?I have my reasons. GERALT: I\\'d like to say I\\'m doing it for you, for a cause... But the truth is far less lofty. A certain elf prophesied that I\\'d recover my memory during this battle.SASKIA: I had no idea you believed in prophecies.GERALT: I don\\'t. But I also don\\'t have a choice. I need to try. If my amnesia was magically induced, the elf\\'s prophecy is just common sense.GERALT: When I lift the curse, a shock wave will roll across the battlefield, a wave of pure, uncontrolled Power looking for an outlet. As soon as it finds one, a strong field of antimagic will arise. Who knows what might happen to someone subjected to these extreme conditions, but something\\'s gotta give. I\\'m fresh out of alternatives.Your ideals - I share them. GERALT: Let\\'s say it’s a question of ideals – I espouse the same ones you do.SASKIA: You may yet prove a revolutionary.GERALT: No, not bloodthirsty enough. Speaking of which... ever stopped to wonder that all your commanders are natural born killers?SASKIA: It has crossed my mind. The truth is, many find peace far harder to bear than war.GERALT: Can I ask you a personal question?SASKIA: Mhm.GERALT: How did you get caught up in this?SASKIA: It\\'s the way I was raised. I should say, it\\'s how my father raised me. My mother died in childbirth. I knew my father – or at least, bits and pieces of him. He was a little like you – never wore out his welcome...SASKIA: But he did succeed in teaching me two things: honor, and how to be free. My choice was to spit on those ideals or to fight.Lifting curses is my profession. GERALT: I\\'m a witcher. Curses are my hobby.SASKIA: I see, the famous neutrality...GERALT: That, too. Besides which, I don\\'t believe any revolution can ultimately be successful. A very important rule: no ideal is worth dying for.SASKIA: I understand. Good luck with the curse. And thank you again.SASKIA: Good luck, witcher. We await your return.  4.12 - THE ETERNAL BATTLE < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[With Vandergrift\\'s sword received from Saskia, Geralt goes to ask Philippa for the last two artifacts needed to lift the curse.]GERALT: I\\'m ready to lift the curse. I\\'ve got all the artifacts.PHILIPPA: Get to work then, witcher.GERALT: I\\'ll need your help. I need to find the right ghosts, somehow.PHILIPPA: They will find you. The aura of the artifacts will lure them. Let them think, speak and act. Then you\\'ll know what to do.PHILIPPA: Geralt, there is something else out there... I scanned the battlefield and noticed The Visitor\\'s ghost. It\\'s different from the others - it has changed.GERALT: A draug. I expected as much.PHILIPPA: Good luck, witcher.[Geralt enters the mist. One of the specters possesses him.]AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: It\\'s warm...AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 2: A lovely autumn. I bet the fruit is plentiful.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: We won\\'t be the ones pickin\\' it.AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: You\\'ll be picking enemy heads. Today.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: No reason to wait. Slaughter the Kaedweni mutts!AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Wait! The time\\'s not right.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 2: Sometimes I forget what we\\'re fighting for.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: Powerful kings have no choice but to wage wars.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 2: Then why don\\'t Demavend and Henselt duel to settle things?! My brother-in-law is from Kaedwen. A decent fellow.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: Once I was at a market there. Quality goods - cheaper than our merchants\\', too.AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Bloody hell, shut it! Every Kaedweni is a bastard! Do you know what they\\'ll do to our women if we lose this battle?!AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: Have you forgotten that they\\'ve come to pillage, burn and steal our land?! Are we to give it away?!AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: Whoresons\\' seed! At \\'em!AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: No! Wait for the signal!AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: There\\'s no time to lose!AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Silence! Archers! Light your arrows! Aim at the first ditch![The arrows fly.]AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Get them! Capture the enemy standard![Across the field, a draug made of the enemy\\'s standard bearer assembles itself. Geralt, in the form of the Aedirnian soldier, defeats it. The ghost leaves him, and a Kaedweni ghost possesses him next.]KAEDWENI OFFICER: The standard\\'s in enemy hands! We\\'re sitting ducks here! You need to tell the commander we were ambushed. We can\\'t hold without reinforcements!KAEDWENI SOLDIER: I\\'m to tell him?!KAEDWENI OFFICER: No, Princess Syphilis! Move it, imbecile, before they slaughter us to a man!KAEDWENI SOLDIER: I shan\\'t make it... First battle... Killed my first man... Got blood on my hands...[Arrows rain down on the Kaedweni soldiers.]KAEDWENI OFFICER: Take cover! They\\'re shooting!KAEDWENI OFFICER: Run, you fool! Deliver the message![Geralt, in the form of the soldier, runs across the battlefield to the commander.]KAEDWENI OFFICER: Cease shooting! He\\'s one of ours![Geralt approaches a massive draug, created from the ghost of Vandergrift, the Visitor.]GERALT: My Lord, the leader of the Dun Banner sent me. We were ambushed! We can\\'t hold!VANDERGRIFT: Weren\\'t your scouts keenly watching the battlefield, captain?KAEDWENI SOLDIER: Yes, sir! They must have dug those ditches in the night, the field was clear by day. Lady Glevissig scanned it with her magic during the night.VANDERGRIFT: Ten lashes to each scout, hang every third one.GERALT: My lord, we need support.VANDERGRIFT: There will be no reinforcements. You must hold. And you, Glevissig... I\\'ll settle this after the battle. The King will learn of your incompetence.SABRINA: Battles are won or lost by the commanders, not by sorceresses. Remember, I\\'ll make a report, too, and...VANDERGRIFT: I\\'ve finished talking to you, witch. Time to win this battle. My Lords, to your banners! We enter the fray!SABRINA: Maybe you\\'ve finished with me, but that doesn\\'t mean I\\'ve finished with you.[The soldier\\'s ghost releases Geralt, and he watches as Sabrina steps away and casts a spell, planting her staff in the ground.]SABRINA: Nadovessiveg.[Philippa, Síle, and two other sorceresses manifest.]PHILIPPA: How can we help you, Sabrina?SABRINA: My place at Henselt\\'s court is threatened. Furthermore, if Vandergrift wins the battle, nothing will stop Henselt from taking Upper Aedirn.PHILIPPA: The balance of power in the North will be upset. What do you intend?SABRINA: I shall summon Melgar\\'s Fire to the battlefield. It will kill Vandergrift and weaken both sides.PHILIPPA: Any use of unconventional weapons may be severely censured.SABRINA: I\\'m aware of that.PHILIPPA: Henselt\\'s hegemony is counter to the Lodge\\'s plans. We will help you, but remember... in the event that you fail, you\\'ll be on your own.SABRINA: I am ready.[The ghost of Seltkirk dispatches a Kaedweni soldier.]SELTKIRK: That\\'s all you\\'ve got?! You\\'re dying fast, like roaches under my boot! Is there a Kaedweni to match Seltkirk of Gulet on this field?![Seltkirk\\'s ghost possesses Geralt. He fights his way through Kaedweni wraiths until he reaches an open field where the Kaedweni standard bearer awaits. Geralt tears free from the ghost\\'s influence.]SELTKIRK: The Visitor! I\\'ve long awaited this meeting.GERALT: Leave, ghost.SELTKIRK: I\\'ll not give up an opportunity to duel Vandergrift.GERALT: He will kill you.SELTKIRK: Seltkirk does not fear death.GERALT: When you die, your soldiers will die every day afterwards. Forever... Leave! This is a task for a witcher, not a knight.SELTKIRK: I do this solely for my men.[Seltkirk leaves, and Geralt defeats the standard bearer.]KAEDWENI STANDARD BEARER: Mercy...VANDERGRIFT: You have failed me.GERALT: Who are you?VANDERGRIFT: Hah! Your nightmare![Geralt defeats the draug. Around the battlefield, Sabrina\\'s meteors begin to fall.]SELTKIRK: Should have stayed at home, Vandergrift. Cursed mages! To die after such a victory! Gods! We can\\'t fight such sorcery.CHREST: It\\'s sorcerous hail! Unclean fire! We\\'re doomed!KAEDWENI SOLDIER 1: Why are they doing this?!CHREST: As the prophecy sayeth, \"And the time will come when sorceresses turn on men, flaming balls rain from the sky and destruction will be unleashed!\"KAEDWENI SOLDIER 2: What should we do? Wait here for death?!CHREST: I shall lead you, as a shepherd leads his flock, safely from the dark abyss![Reverend Chrest\\'s ghost possesses Geralt. He leads the Kaedweni soldiers to King Henselt\\'s position near the edge of the mist.]CHREST: Stop firing! Our men are dying! A massacre! Save us, Sire!HENSELT: Sabrina, is that your work?SABRINA: Order your troops forward, Your Majesty. The Aedirnian army is routed.HENSELT: Not only the Aedirnian. Look at that terrified horde - this very morning they were the finest of my knights.SABRINA: They\\'ll make it if they\\'re reinforced.HENSELT: Who allowed you to use magic?SABRINA: Sire, if you strike now, Lormark will be yours!HENSELT: You\\'ve tainted my honor, brought death to dozens of knights...SABRINA: Sire, the battle was lost...HENSELT: You put me to shame before Demavend. His troops fought like men of honor should - to the end. Sabrina Glevissig, I sentence you to death. You shall burn at the stake.HENSELT: I will return to claim my birthright...[Geralt experiences a flashback.  GERALT, NARRATING: July 25, 1270 – The forests of Angren. \"No mighty mortal, no heap of meat or strongman can parry the strike of the slyzard\\'s tail...\" Letho couldn’t either, but by some miracle, he survived. I helped him. After all, witchers on the Path should help each other. The Hunt continued south, and Letho of Gulet knew where it was going. He had two comrades, brother witchers from the School of the Viper. He knew where the hellish chase would end.][Geralt awakens in Philippa\\'s quarters.]PHILIPPA: You\\'re finally awake.GERALT: Am I dead or hallucinating?PHILIPPA: You wouldn\\'t meet me in the beyond.GERALT: I don\\'t remember coming here.PHILIPPA: Because you didn\\'t. Don\\'t forget, we sorceresses have our ways.GERALT: In that case, thanks for your help.PHILIPPA: You\\'re too valuable to let die. You did the impossible. I don\\'t know anyone who could deal with such a powerful curse.You\\'re right. GERALT: Neither do I.Now you tell me... GERALT: You never said I\\'d face certain death.PHILIPPA: I never stopped believing in you.I\\'ll be famous. GERALT: I can\\'t wait for people in every village to start recounting tales of my heroic deeds.PHILIPPA: Now tell me everything that happened.I have no idea. GERALT: I can\\'t remember, either how I left the mist, or what happened within.I saw everything. GERALT: I saw Henselt sentencing Sabrina to death. I killed the draug...PHILIPPA: You must have, since the curse is gone.GERALT: I saw Vandergrift... I saw a rain of fireballs and death all around me. Everywhere.PHILIPPA: Henselt is a criminal. He used the circumstances to kill Sabrina. He hated her.GERALT: That\\'s why you sided with Aedirn? For vengeance?PHILIPPA: It\\'s not about vengeance, it\\'s about a better world. A world without Henselts.GERALT: That\\'s utopia.PHILIPPA: Passing through such a concentrated mass of the Power opens the mind.GERALT: Cedric was right. The Power of the wraiths\\' battle restores memory.PHILIPPA: And what have you recalled?GERALT: Letho... Foltest\\'s murderer. I saved him once, and he helped me find the Wild Hunt. I just don\\'t know if we managed to save Yennefer.PHILIPPA: Did you learn anything else about the Hunt?GERALT: When I killed the King of the Hunt, I killed a wraith... In my memories, I fight the Hunt\\'s riders... Blood flows from their wounds, and they cry out in pain.PHILIPPA: Which means you do not yet know all.GERALT: Not to worry - I will.PHILIPPA: You lifted the curse, but there\\'s no time to rest. Henselt\\'s army will attack at any moment.What about Saskia? GERALT: How\\'s Saskia feeling?PHILIPPA: Completely recovered. She can\\'t wait to deal with Henselt. She will personally command the defense of Vergen. She\\'s in her element.GERALT: A siege can\\'t be her element if she never faced one.PHILIPPA: You underestimate her. Keep in mind she\\'s got allies: a famous witcher and... me.I had no other choice. GERALT: Perhaps I helped Henselt and put Aedirn in danger by lifting the curse, but I had no other choice.PHILIPPA: Sometimes you need to amputate the leg to save the body.GERALT: Time to decide the outcome of this war.PHILIPPA: High time. Zoltan and Yarpen are setting up the troops. They\\'re waiting for you.  4.13 - VERGEN BESIEGED < PREV CONTENTS[Geralt heads to the main gate where the dwarves are preparing.]SASKIA: Zoltan, prepare the main gate\\'s defenses. I\\'ll cover the wall.ZOLTAN: The defense will be so strong, Henselt\\'s stick will go limp.ZOLTAN: Let\\'s get on those walls, lads! The Kaedweni are coming. We\\'ll greet them in a neighborly manner.GERALT: You\\'re quite the general, Zoltan.ZOLTAN: Why not call me a bloody marshal?! Saskia\\'s got it into her head it\\'s either me or Yarpen. We drew straws and I lost.ZOLTAN: It\\'s good you\\'re up. Henselt will be here any minute.GERALT: Why? Would he be disappointed not to see me?ZOLTAN: He\\'d be bloody depressed!Are you ready? GERALT: How are preparations to greet our visitors going?ZOLTAN: Have no fear. We\\'ll give \\'em a taste of what\\'s due to anyone who\\'s as welcome as warts on the arse. We\\'ll give them a royal welcome. The dwarves are eager for a scuffle.Defeating Henselt won\\'t be easy. GERALT: Henselt\\'s experienced at waging wars, too.ZOLTAN: Experienced my arse! Once they stand beneath the walls, we\\'ll douse them in hot oil and set them ablaze.ZOLTAN: Just do your part, and Kaedweni heads will fly like fattened horseflies.[The camera shifts, showing a unit of Kaedweni soldiers charging towards Vergen\\'s main entrance.]DWARF: The Kaedweni are coming!ZOLTAN: They multiplied or what?GERALT: Time to give them a taste of hot oil.ZOLTAN: There are valves on the cauldrons\\' sides. You need to clear them. I\\'ll take the left side, you get the right.[Geralt heads up onto the walls towards the valves, fighting Kaedweni soldiers as he goes.]ZOLTAN: Hurry up, Geralt! If we don\\'t cover them in oil, they\\'ll cover us with their Kaedweni arses!ZOLTAN: Aaaargh! Come on!GERALT: Together!ZOLTAN: All right, it\\'s done!GERALT: That hot oil was a great idea!ZOLTAN: Well... Now they\\'ll sear a bit!GERALT: They sure won\\'t feel cold.ZOLTAN: They fry up lovely![Geralt returns to Zoltan. Behind the barricade, Dethmold is visible at the head of the advancing unit. He blasts through the barricade with a spell.]ZOLTAN: Fall back behind the second gate or they\\'ll kill us to a man!GERALT: Fall back![Geralt and the Vergeni fall back to the inner gates; Sheldon closes the gates behind them.]ZOLTAN: Stop farting around. To the walls, like a shot!GERALT: At once, brave leader![Geralt and Zoltan join Saskia on the walls.]SASKIA: Hold the lines!SASKIA: Show them how Aedirnian soldiers fight!SHELDON: Upper Aedirn!DWARF: Saskiaaaa![The Kaedwenis bring ladders to the walls; Geralt and the Vergeni forces repel a wave of soldiers coming up.]ZOLTAN: We repelled those Kaedweni rags!GERALT: They won\\'t give up easily.ZOLTAN: They\\'ll return if they\\'re thick as bricks! To find bricks falling on their heads!SASKIA: Another assault is coming! Get ready!SASKIA: The day will be ours! It must be![The wall defenders defeat another wave of soldiers.]ZOLTAN: Well... it wasn\\'t easy, but seeing those ruffians run was worth the effort.GERALT: They\\'ll be back. They\\'re as stubborn as a dwarven farmer.ZOLTAN: Huh. But their balls are much smaller![Saskia approaches Geralt.]SASKIA: I need your help, witcher.GERALT: I\\'m hearing that more often lately.SASKIA: Seems you\\'re irreplaceable. Listen, tunnels run beneath the town and connect the keep with the dwarven mines.GERALT: Who knows about them?SASKIA: Almost no one, but I decided to secure them anyway and sent a detachment of scouts. None of them returned.Not good. GERALT: If Henselt discovered the passage, he\\'s got us.ZOLTAN: A bloody gentle way to put it!SASKIA: If they attack from two sides, we won\\'t hold the fortress.I\\'ll look into it. GERALT: Then I\\'ll take a little excursion beyond the town walls.ZOLTAN: Now\\'s the perfect time. Henselt\\'s men lick their wounds like flogged bitches.SASKIA: They\\'ll need about an hour to regroup troops and set up formation for another assault. Let\\'s not waste time. I\\'ll come with you.Your place is here. GERALT: You shouldn\\'t go. It\\'s too dangerous.SASKIA: I thought you more keen. Since when do I avoid danger? The defenses are well prepared. Everyone knows their task. Besides, we\\'ll make it in time...GERALT: I\\'d rather you assigned me an able troop of men.SASKIA: I won\\'t reform ranks now. This formation is effective. If they don\\'t strike suddenly from the mines, we should hold through the siege.GERALT: You\\'re in charge. Lead on.[Saskia and Geralt head towards the tunnel.]SASKIA: You surprise me more and more. I thought witchers stayed out of politics.GERALT: I\\'m not interested in politics.SASKIA: Yet you stand on our side.GERALT: I stand on Zoltan\\'s side... Yarpen\\'s...SASKIA: Would you join them if they fought under a Kaedweni banner?GERALT: No dwarf would fight for Henselt.SASKIA: Let\\'s hurry![Geralt and Saskia enter the tunnel.]GERALT: I\\'ll take the lead. Stay behind me, Saskia.SASKIA: A chivalrous witcher? Another surprise...GERALT: The world\\'s upside down.[Geralt and Saskia find mercenaries in the tunnels; they fight their way through several groups of them before coming upon a final group led by Dethmold.]EVALD DE ALDERSBERG: My Lord, we\\'ll soon reach Vergen. You\\'ll take them by surprise.DETHMOLD: If that\\'s so, you\\'ll be richly rewarded.EVALD: My information is certain. I won\\'t disappoint you.DETHMOLD: You\\'d better not. Or you\\'ll lose your head.DETHMOLD: Vergen is in danger and the Virgin of Aedirn roams the caves with a witcher! I understand... your cherry is aching and thoughts turned to pleasure before death!DETHMOLD: Kill them.[Saskia and Geralt clash with Dethmold\\'s men. Dethmold hits Geralt with a firebolt that incapacitates him. Saskia gasps and begins to glow unearthly white, then transforms into a dragon. Dethmold flees into a portal and Saskia\\'s dragon form dispatches the remaining mercenaries. Geralt manages to get to his feet as Saskia transforms back.]GERALT: I know a woman is flighty. But to that scale?SASKIA: Now you know my greatest secret. I had no choice - they would\\'ve killed you.Now I understand how you withstood the toxin. GERALT: Now I understand how you could combat such a powerful toxin.SASKIA: Philippa is a great sorceress.GERALT: Even she couldn\\'t have saved you if you were human.SASKIA: You\\'re a witcher, so you know a lot about us.GERALT: Only golden dragons have the power to assume any form.SASKIA: My father was a knight with bright eyes. He treated life like a beautiful adventure. He loved humans and tried to understand them. Thanks to him, I believe every man is equal and liberty shouldn\\'t be peddled. Father claimed the world to be filled with chaos and order. Chaos equals aggression, order is the defense against it.GERALT: What happened to him?SASKIA: He taught me to live among humans and moved on. Dragons do that.Was it you at the siege of La Valette Castle? GERALT: A dragon appeared during the siege of the La Valettes\\' castle...SASKIA: I was helping Aryan La Valette.GERALT: Why?SASKIA: He fought against tyranny and its transgressions. I understood him very well. Vergen could have used someone like him.Anyone else know the truth? GERALT: Does anyone else know?SASKIA: Dethmold.GERALT: I meant allies. Iorveth...?SASKIA: Iorveth invented the whole \\'Dragonslayer\\' story. He believes Aedirn needs someone like me. And someone like me needs a legend. He was right.Even Henselt can\\'t defeat an army supported by a dragon... GERALT: If a dragon helped Vergen\\'s defenders... Henselt wouldn\\'t stand a chance.SASKIA: I thought about that. But what would happen to Upper Aedirn when the dust settles?They\\'d renounce you. GERALT: You\\'d have to leave.SASKIA: Yes. The people of Aedirn know me as the Dragonslayer. That\\'s why they respect me. Maybe not the only reason, but if they learned I\\'m a dragon, they\\'d feel betrayed.It\\'s hard to blame them. GERALT: They\\'d have a point.SASKIA: I didn\\'t want to deceive anyone. And then it was just too late...Maybe ending the masquerade is worth it? GERALT: But if Vergen falls, your ideals will be vanquished. Maybe averting that is worth the sacrifice?That\\'s not something you can foresee. GERALT: You can\\'t foresee everything.SASKIA: You know how the world treats freaks as well as I do.GERALT: But if Vergen falls, your ideals will be vanquished. Maybe averting that is worth the sacrifice?SASKIA: Let\\'s, for a moment, assume I revealed my dual nature. Who would lead Upper Aedirn? Do you see a replacement for me?GERALT: It\\'s hard to imagine one that compares to you.SASKIA: Dwarves will support their own candidate, elves theirs, and humans will start looking for a king. That\\'s why I must ask you to keep this knowledge to yourself. We\\'ll have to deal with Henselt without a dragon\\'s help.SASKIA: And we will. Also thanks to you. I\\'ll never forget what you\\'re doing for Aedirn, no matter your reasons, witcher.GERALT: Let\\'s go. The defenders need you.[Geralt and Saskia leave the tunnels, where they find Zoltan waiting for them.]SASKIA: What happened while I was gone, Zoltan?ZOLTAN: The fun is about to begin. Herdsman Henselt personally leads all his cattle here.SASKIA: We\\'ll win. Is that all?[If Geralt helped the two trolls] ZOLTAN: Ah... We\\'ve got unexpected guests.SASKIA: Who?ZOLTAN: I think one of them\\'s a she. Ugly like shite after winter, but she\\'s got tits. You should have seen our lads\\' faces when those eyesores entered the courtyard.SASKIA: Did they say why they want to help us?ZOLTAN: Wizer good. Wizer\\'s foe is troll\\'s foe.GERALT: I met this pair. They can be of use.SASKIA: Good! We want to create a land without prejudice.[If Geralt killed the trolls] ZOLTAN: You won\\'t believe it. Pangratt and his cutthroats offered to help us.GERALT: Can we afford them?SASKIA: I won\\'t turn down any help, especially from a hero of Brenna, but my coffer\\'s empty.ZOLTAN: I was bloody surprised, but they don\\'t want any money!SASKIA: Even better, then. And worse for Henselt.ZOLTAN: When news that Henselt will personally lead the assault spread, the spirit of our lads fell into the gutter.GERALT: Tell them, Zoltan, that if they don\\'t believe in victory, they might as well fly a white flag.ZOLTAN: I tried, but they still look down.SASKIA: Gather the defenders, Zoltan.[Back on the walls, Vergen\\'s forces look despondent. Saskia addresses them.]SASKIA: Why so quiet?! I thought you\\'d be merry! King Henselt himself will honor us with a visit!DWARF 1: We\\'re all gonna die...HUMAN: We can\\'t repel the attack!SCOIA\\'TAEL: Henselt is invincible...SASKIA: We won\\'t be fighting mere minions, but their King! And the King himself will have to recognize our victory! Could a soldier dream of better than defeating a monarch?!SASKIA: Or maybe you\\'re afraid to fight? Maybe we should fly a white flag? It\\'s so simple... Henselt will quickly set up his order here.SASKIA: Inns will be marked \\'Humans only\\'. Dwarves will choke in the mines, elves will perish, hunted in the forests! Lords will slaughter peasants because they didn\\'t bow low enough!SASKIA: Is that the land you want to leave to your children?!DWARF 2: No!HUMAN: Never!SASKIA: You\\'re shitting bricks because Henselt is coming! Who is he?! A god?!SASKIA: No... He has arms... Legs... And blood. As red as any of ours! If he dares to cross these walls... Then we\\'ll gladly spill some of it!DWARF 3: Yes!DWARF 1: Get Henselt!SCOIA\\'TAEL: Long live Saskia!SASKIA: Many of you won\\'t see the light of dawn again. Many won\\'t return to your women or drink with friends. But we will care for and honor their graves when they enter the earth. Aedirnian earth! Those who survive will live with their heads held high! For only such a life makes sense!SASKIA: Now, to arms and to the walls! Let\\'s show Henselt real war![The defenders cheer. Below the walls, Dethmold begins building a fireball, which he casts at Vergen\\'s gate.]ZOLTAN: They\\'re coming! Let\\'s kick a few more Kaedweni arses!GERALT: Henselt will pay dearly for this siege.HENSELT: Men of Kaedwen! Attaaaaack![Across from the inner walls\\' defenders, on the outer wall, Iorveth emerges. Dozens of elven archers appear behind him and launch a barrage of arrows onto Henselt\\'s forces.][Character animatic plays. GERALT, NARRATING: Terrorists, murderers, a death squad, or freedom fighters, in an uneven battle, noble in their suffering. It all depends on your point of view. I helped Iorveth. I gave him my trust. I joined Saskia and took the side of the rebels, their new values and ideals. Time will tell if I was right. One thing is sure: elves are the best archers who have ever walked this earth.]SASKIA: Iorveth! That\\'s what I call an entrance!GERALT: I have to admit, the Squirrel has style.SASKIA: Not all is lost! We need to cut off Henselt\\'s escape!GERALT: What are you talking about?! He looks as if he likes it here!SASKIA: He\\'ll change his mind! Join Iorveth and shut the main gate.GERALT: Yarpen says Dethmold\\'s magic damaged it.ZOLTAN: Yarpen knows fuck all about gates. Cover my arse and I\\'ll close it!SASKIA: The fate of the battle hangs on it, dwarf.ZOLTAN: There\\'s no bloody gate that Zoltan Chivay can\\'t close![Geralt and Zoltan climb down from the wall and head around towards Iorveth and his archers.]ZOLTAN: Pull up the ladder!DWARF: Yes, sir!GERALT: Iorveth! We need to get to the main gate! Now!IORVETH: Admit it - you thought I wouldn\\'t come back, Gwynbleidd...GERALT: You\\'re hellishly good. We need to stop Henselt from retreating.IORVETH: And then force him to try it.ZOLTAN: There\\'s no time to waste! To the gate![Geralt and Iorveth cover Zoltan as he goes to close the gate.]ZOLTAN: Done!IORVETH: They\\'re cut off like sitting ducks.GERALT: Maybe they\\'ll surrender.[Henselt and his men are left trapped between the two courtyards as the Scoia\\'tael continue to fire into their ranks.]SOLDIER: Sire... Your orders...?HENSELT: We surrender.[Philippa and Saskia descend to negotiate with Henselt.]SASKIA: The battle is over, King.HENSELT: You won. And the victors state their terms.SASKIA: You know my terms. You will relinquish Aedirn and sign an act of unconditional surrender in which you\\'ll promise your troops will never cross the Pontar.HENSELT: Is that all?SASKIA: You\\'ll pay war reparations and recognize the free realm of Upper Aedirn with Saskia of Vergen at its head.HENSELT: What about me and my men? What awaits us?SASKIA: Freedom. It\\'s a great thing. Look how many of my soldiers died defending it.HENSELT: How much do you want?PHILIPPA: We\\'ll discuss the war reparations in detail at Loc Muinne. Before esteemed witnesses. There\\'s one thing Saskia didn\\'t mention.HENSELT: I\\'m listening.PHILIPPA: Since the dawn of time, wars were, are and will yet be. One side wins, the other loses. But military conflict should be carried out under chivalrous rules and laws.HENSELT: What\\'s your point, sorceress?SASKIA: War criminals, including Dethmold, must be punished.HENSELT: I need an advisor.SASKIA: War criminals must be punished.PHILIPPA: You\\'ll have a new advisor - Síle de Tansarville.HENSELT: Has this witch gone mad?!PHILIPPA: It\\'s a necessary condition.SASKIA: Dethmold committed a crime and he must be punished.HENSELT: As you wish.SASKIA: Execute him.DETHMOLD: Don\\'t allow them to harass me like a dog.[Two Scoia\\'tael take Dethmold away.]DETHMOLD: You\\'ll see how a real sorcerer dies, foolish whores.[The Scoia\\'tael force him down over an anvil and a dwarf cuts off his head.]PHILIPPA: Swear an oath and you\\'ll walk free.HENSELT: Who am I negotiating with anyway?SASKIA: Philippa Eilhart and I speak with one voice.HENSELT: Be wary of the sorceresses. They often forget whose perch is higher.SASKIA: Philippa is my advisor.PHILIPPA: We await your decision, King.HENSELT: I, King Henselt, Lord of Kaedwen, swear before witnesses that I will relinquish Aedirnian borders. I recognize Saskia of Vergen\\'s reign in the realm of the Pontar Valley. And I swear to pay war reparations in the amount agreed upon at Loc Muinne.SASKIA: You\\'re free.PHILIPPA: Show the King the way out.[A couple of dwarves lead Henselt away.]PHILIPPA: It\\'s time to go, Saskia.SASKIA: Yes.[Saskia and Philippa walk away.]IORVETH: I don\\'t like it.GERALT: What?IORVETH: Saskia, I know her well. She\\'s never behaved like that.GERALT: Her eyes look as if she\\'s taken fisstech.IORVETH: I assure you, she doesn\\'t use it. Let\\'s follow them.[Geralt and Iorveth follow the two towards Philippa\\'s quarters, but they disappear into a portal before entering the house.]IORVETH: They disappeared.GERALT: A teleport.IORVETH: Let\\'s search Eilhart\\'s house. She was in a hurry, maybe she left something.[Geralt and Iorveth comb through Philippa\\'s rooms.]IORVETH: Let\\'s take a look.IORVETH: Hmmm... I\\'ve got nothing. Except for women\\'s finery.IORVETH: If only this bed could speak...GERALT: Iorveth! Over here. I\\'ve got something...IORVETH: What is it?GERALT: A tome of potion recipes.IORVETH: We\\'ve no time to read books.GERALT: Sorceresses carefully guard books like this.IORVETH: Not that carefully. After all, she left it behind.GERALT: She was in a hurry.IORVETH: Could this book have anything to do with the Dragonslayer?It\\'s very valuable. GERALT: Even if it doesn\\'t, it\\'s still very valuable.IORVETH: I\\'m sure it\\'s filled with recipes Eilhart used to send many to eternity.GERALT: You\\'re right.It may have something to do with the dragon. GERALT: Most things in this land seem to have something to do with Saskia, the dragon.IORVETH: How do you know?GERALT: She told me.IORVETH: Then keep your mouth shut, Gwynbleidd, because if...GERALT: I know what will happen if they learn, Iorveth.GERALT: I\\'ve found thaumador\\'s recipe.IORVETH: Eilhart already told us the ingredients for magepain. How is it relevant?GERALT: Usually, the recipe for an antidote is right next to the one for the poison.IORVETH: I can recite it exactly. Royal blood, an immortelle, a dragon\\'s dream and petals from a rose of remembrance.GERALT: Yet this book doesn\\'t even mention a rose of remembrance.IORVETH: I recall perfectly that Eilhart said a rose of remembrance, combined with an immortelle, heals the mind.GERALT: What if she lied? Maybe it doesn\\'t heal the mind but influences it. Philippa passed the flower to Saskia through a kiss - the symbol of love and perdition.IORVETH: I\\'m confused.GERALT: I think Philippa subjugated Saskia\\'s mind by adding the rose to the antidote.IORVETH: I\\'ll kill that bitch.GERALT: Philippa has magic and an obedient dragon at her command. She could have a strong influence on the conference.IORVETH: But what does she want?GERALT: We can only learn that in Loc Muinne.IORVETH: Let\\'s go then, Gwynbleidd...[Zoltan and Dandelion are waiting for them outside.]DANDELION: Geralt! Saskia\\'s disappeared. People are getting riled.ZOLTAN: Dwarves, too.Saskia\\'s left to negotiate with the kings. GERALT: Saskia\\'s gone to the summit that\\'s supposed to reestablish the Council and Conclave. She wants the kings assembling at Loc Muinne to recognize Vergen\\'s independence.ZOLTAN: The lass has got gumption.DANDELION: But everything\\'ll go to hell without her! We showed Henselt his place, but what of it if everything falls apart now? Someone\\'s got to bring these folks together. Without that - it\\'ll have been a hollow victory.Saskia is bound by a spell. GERALT: Saskia\\'s spellbound. Philippa controls her.ZOLTAN: You\\'re shittin\\' me!DANDELION: I knew something was up! I could feel it! She ordered Dethmold executed, no trial, just like that... A gesture from Philippa is all it took!ZOLTAN: That bastard deserved it.DANDELION: I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Zoltan had ordered it, as vengeful as he is. But Saskia...?ZOLTAN: Where is she?GERALT: Philippa\\'s taken her to Loc Muinne.GERALT: I\\'m going after Saskia, with Iorveth. Everything suggests those responsible for Foltest\\'s death will be at Loc Muinne.ZOLTAN: Some still say you killed him.GERALT: I\\'ve gotta stop that drivel - don\\'t have a choice. But you do.DANDELION: The elite of the North is gathering at Loc Muinne. I couldn\\'t forgive myself if I wasn\\'t there - it\\'d be a sin against art!ZOLTAN: The art of poking your nose in others\\' business.IORVETH: You\\'ll be needed here until Saskia returns. Order must prevail, there can be no strife. The victory over Henselt was an important step, but only the first on a long road.DANDELION: The hymn I composed could help.GERALT: Vergen\\'ll need many more songs.DANDELION: I certainly hope our paths will cross again, Geralt of Rivia.GERALT: Stop dramatizing. You can be sure of that. We\\'ve got unfinished business of our own.ZOLTAN: Huh? Oh, aye.IORVETH: Let\\'s go then, Gwynbleidd...[Geralt and Iorveth leave Vergen. Iorveth takes one moment to look back over his shoulder, then the two of them depart.][DANDELION, NARRATING: Síle de Tansarville! I\\'d sensed from the start that some dark mystery lay behind that cold countenance...\\xa0Following the demise of the Council and Conclave, there was no one left to keep the mages in line, but regicide? Why? What was this all about? It seemed these questions would be answered at Loc Muinne... an ancient city amidst mountains, the remnants of the civilization of the Vrans, whose dusk had come long ago.\\xa0And you would be right to ask, \"Why did you not set out for Loc Muinne, Master Dandelion?\" Vergen was free. Yet what is freedom without its awareness? It might too easily pass from hand to hand were a nation to lack individuals capable of pointing the way. I remained in the Pontar Valley. That is the task Fate seemed to assign me - to safeguard freedom as it budded and bloomed.\\xa0Yet forever feeling a vast, shared responsbiilty for the fate of the North, I dispatched to Loc Muinne my faithful and capable friend, Geralt of Rivia. Have I mentioned his disdain for politics? Well, it was at Loc Muinne where he could finally give vent to it.]Back to topDocument © Laurelnose. The Witcher © respective owners.

Bones everywhere! How in the world did Glevissig harness so much of the Power?SÍLE: Do you always get so excited at the sight of skulls, Dethmold?DETHMOLD: Scoff all you want. I speak of magic! The kind of spells that win wars! Thousands incinerated in seconds! Mmmmwaah! Power, destruction, annihilation!SÍLE: Yes, after which Sabrina Glevissig was burned at the stake, and the Pontar Valley remains within Aedirn\\'s borders.DETHMOLD: Aedirn is a carcass! Still showing life signs, but the realm\\'s days are numbered. No peasant revolt can change that!HENSELT: You\\'re wrong, Dethmold. This country lives, I can feel it. Like an old, wounded bear, covered in scars, hounds all around it, but still strong, still deadly. This will be a good war.DETHMOLD: But, Sire! The Aedirnian barons won\\'t dare stand against you. You shall see that shortly, I\\'ve prepared everything!DETHMOLD: De Tansarville, can you feel that? Magic still beats strongly in this place. Shivers run down my spine.SÍLE: Hm. Strange... Glevissig\\'s Quadruple Sun is a short duration spell. It should have dissipated long ago.DETHMOLD: An anomaly, perhaps? Not uncommon... The sheer amount of Power she summoned – I doubt she retained complete control...HENSELT: Stop discussing Sabrina Glevissig or I promise you that heads will roll.DETHMOLD: Baron Felart has forever hinted that he would gladly change his colors...SÍLE: Felart is unparalleled scum.DETHMOLD: The other nobles are panic-stricken at the very thought of Saskia with her peasant and nonhuman rebels. They are unprepared to fight and know it very well.HENSELT: And Demavend\\'s cub? Has he named his price?DETHMOLD: Prince Stennis has yet to respond, but Felart has assured me...HENSELT: I must see him, look into his eyes. I\\'ll know what he\\'s made of, then.[Henselt, Síle, and Dethmold make their way down the hill to the tent where the Aedirnian nobles are waiting.]FELART: We most humbly greet His Majesty Henselt, King of Kaedwen, heir to the Dynasty of the Unicorn, Lord of Ard Carraigh, Archduke of Ban Ard and vanquisher of Nilfgaard!NOBLEMAN: Welcome to Aedirn.HENSELT: How much do you want?FELART: You Majesty surely jests...HENSELT: I couldn\\'t be more serious. How much for your signatures?FELART: A hundred thousand Novigrad crowns, we thought. To each of us. And the titles of marquis.DETHMOLD: Ooooh!FELART: We speak of Upper Aedirn, of coal and silver mines, numerous factories, the sole white marble quarry this side of the Yaruga, and the North\\'s main east-west trade route...DETHMOLD: We speak of Lormark. I advise you to adopt the new nomenclature.FELART: In exchange, we shall swear fealty and acknowledge Your Majesty as sovereign of these lands.I\\'ll give you half. HENSELT: You\\'ll receive fifty thousand apiece and no additional titles.HENSELT: Also, you\\'ll provide guides and supplies to my army. My men will install themselves in your castles. Your armed men will gather under sorcerer Dethmold\\'s command and will set out to quell the peasant rebellion.FELART: Sire, the common folk will hate... They simply won\\'t understand...HENSELT: Yes, Felart, they will hate you. But at least this way you\\'ll live. Comfortably, I might add. Refuse and die – by my hand or that of Saskia the Dragonslayer.FELART: Sire... We accept your conditions.HENSELT: Dethmold – the scroll!FELART: Sire, there is yet the matter of Prince Stennis and his rights to these lands. So long as he lives... Ahem... So long as the Prince lives, he\\'ll force his claims...HENSELT: Then kill him, Felart.FELART: Sire, I\\'m no warrior.HENSELT: In that case, shut up and sign.KAEDWENI KNIGHT: Sire, the Dragonslayer approaches, white flag in hand!HENSELT: Excellent, let her pass.DETHMOLD: What are you waiting for? Pick up those quills and sign.I\\'ll give you nothing. HENSELT: I shall give you naught for your worthless signatures. I have no need of them.NOBLEMAN: But Your Majesty, without our support you\\'ll forever be the invader, the occupying force, the enemy. The folk of Aedirn...HENSELT: The folk of Aedirn follows Saskia the Dragonslayer and Prince Stennis. I wish to speak to them.KAEDWENI KNIGHT: Sire, the Dragonslayer approaches, white flag in hand!HENSELT: Excellent, let her pass.[Saskia arrives with Prince Stennis and a priest.]SASKIA: Just out of curiosity... What does Upper Aedirn sell for these days?[If Henselt didn\\'t pay] DETHMOLD: How much do you demand... lass?[If Henselt paid] DETHMOLD: Fifty thousand. How much would you have demanded... lass?SASKIA: King, command your vulture to shut his beak, before I thrust his cockerel up his arse and twist so hard he\\'ll crow until noon reverts to morning.DETHMOLD: I... Sire, you must have her restrained!Silence, Dethmold. HENSELT: Shut up, Dethmold. I\\'ve rather taken a liking to this Saskia. Say your piece, woman.SASKIA: King, withdraw your army, recognize Upper Aedirn\\'s sovereignty, end your persecution of nonhumans and give them leave to quit your realm... Do this and save yourself and your army.HENSELT: Ha–ha–ha! You have balls, woman, but what would I gain? My soldiers would call me a coward. I am Henselt of Ard Carraigh – I\\'ll not run from a woman, even if she be a dragonslayer.SASKIA: I see one other solution.SASKIA: You and I, King. Here and now. Before these folk and the gods. I challenge you. As in the old days, when the honorable ruled this world. Upper Aedirn to the victor.FELART: The lass has gone mad. To challenge a king?!DETHMOLD: Sire, this is absurd! We shall crush them in battle. They say the lass has slain a dragon - she could be dangerous.I\\'ll fight. HENSELT: Precisely why she makes a worthy foe. Don\\'t disappoint me, Dragonslayer. Please, show me how it\\'s done. Begin![Henselt and Saskia meet in single combat.]My plans for you are altogether different. HENSELT: I find you fetching, girl. And I want you alive... I want you and this country.SASKIA: You\\'ll need to take Vergen first.HENSELT: Oh, no. You, then Vergen, then the whole of Aedirn. Grab her![The two sides meet in battle.]Will you threaten me as well? HENSELT: Will you bully me as well?SASKIA: Anything to save Aedirn, King...DETHMOLD: A whore after all.Silence, Dethmold. [Same as above.]You risk much, Saskia. HENSELT: Dethmold may not be the bravest soul, but he is right in one respect. Were I to restrain you, there would be no war. You are either very brave or very stupid...SASKIA: Will you hear me out, King, or must we continue our threats and insults?I\\'ve heard enough. HENSELT: I\\'ll hear no more. Three years past, upon this field, Aedirnians met my army in battle. Those were men of honor! Knights and footmen who fought like lions! Who proved that blood, not water, coursed through their veins!HENSELT: The people of Lormark deserve a strong and just ruler. They need a king. I have a vast, battle-hungry army. You have nothing. Kneel before me, Saskia – you have no other choice.SASKIA: You speak not to subjects but to free folk, King. You come with an army that loots the surrounding villages. You negotiate with traitors of this land. You allow your mages to threaten and offend. And I am to kneel before you?HENSELT: It\\'s the only way.SASKIA: I kneel before no one.[Saskia and her allies attack.]I will hear you out. HENSELT: Tell me what you want.[Continues as from \"SASKIA: King, withdraw your army...\" above.]You\\'re taking a great risk. [Same as \"You risk much, Saskia.\"][If Henselt agreed to single combat] KNIGHT: Opposing one another in a chivalrous duel shall be Henselt of Ard Carraigh, King of Kaedwen, Sovereign of Caingorn and Malleore, last of the line of the Unicorn...KNIGHT: And Saskia - the wench who killed a dragon!KNIGHT: The victor shall take Lormark! May the gods settle this! Begin![Whether in single combat or as an all-out clash, Henselt defeats Saskia. The priest approaches to try and intervene before he kills her.]PRIEST: Stop! Stop in the name of Kreve, Freya and Melitele![Henselt slaughters the priest on the obelisk overlooking the area. It begins to glow with an unearthly blue light. Meanwhile, Geralt and Roche approach the gates of Henselt\\'s fortress.]ZYVIK: Hey! Halt!ROCHE: What\\'s with you, Zyvik? Booze made you batty? Don\\'t you recognize me?ZYVIK: I\\'ll be ploughed and damned! Why the hell did you bring him here, Roche?ROCHE: He\\'s a witcher...ZYVIK: I know who the whoreson is! Ploughing kingslayer at the gate of a king\\'s camp! Why, he\\'s not even bound.ROCHE: Easy, lads. The witcher\\'s no murderer, I\\'ll vouch for that. As for kings... well, I desperately need to see yours.ZYVIK: You\\'re in for a wait then, mister special mission knight! Don\\'t move, mutant! One of you go get the sergeant, and while you\\'re at it, fetch a solid piece of rope to bind the freak!ROCHE: Come on, Zyvik, no need for that. Where\\'d you say the King was?ZYVIK: Out in the fields somewhere – negotiatin\\'. Hey, kingslayer! Drop your weapons - or do I need to pack a bolt up your arse?[Geralt senses someting and turns to look, seeing the blue light from over the hills. Zyvik becomes increasingly agitated.]ZYVIK: Don\\'t move!ZYVIK: Don\\'t even twitch, mutant!ZYVIK: Hands where I can see \\'em!ZYVIK: Shoot!ZYVIK: Smash the freak![Geralt casts Quen and runs in the direction of the unearthly blue light. Roche turns to look up at it himself.]ROCHE: What the fuck?![Stennis and a knight help Saskia to her feet. Everyone makes to flee, but wraiths begin to appear on the battlefield and attack. Geralt and Roche leap in and join the fray.]HENSELT: These specters were my soldiers! It\\'s Sabrina\\'s curse!DETHMOLD: Aedirnians are here as well...GERALT: Admire the sights later. We have to go on.DETHMOLD: Endure, friends! I must focus enough Power for the spell![Dethmold casts a barrier spell shielding the group, and they begin to descend through the spectral mist, fighting wraiths that get through the spell as they go.]DETHMOLD: Ready! Stay close to me!ROCHE: What the hell? Where\\'d the sun go?GERALT: It\\'s an eclipse. Somebody cast a curse. A very powerful one.ROCHE: What do we do?GERALT: We have to get out of here. Specters are only susceptible to silver and spells. Stay behind me.DETHMOLD: I\\'ll try to disperse the fog!HENSELT: It\\'s Glevissig\\'s curse! She\\'s out to kill me!GERALT: Stay close to me, Sire. It\\'s not far now.ROCHE: Let\\'s hope so.[Halfway down, they find Stennis\\' corpse.]HENSELT: It\\'s Prince Stennis... He lives?GERALT: No. The wraiths have taken him.DETHMOLD: The fog is dissipating. We\\'re near its end.[The group exits the mist and arrives at Henselt\\'s camp.]HENSELT: Dethmold, Síle - meet me in my tent. You\\'re to explain what the hell happened there. And how we\\'re to get rid of it!DETHMOLD: As you command, Your Majesty.HENSELT: I\\'ll tolerate no delays on this matter. And summon all my company commanders.DETHMOLD: Immediately, Your Majesty.HENSELT: Corporal, I\\'d like you to watch the witcher closely. He just pulled me from a magic hell, so I doubt he wants my head as he took Foltest\\'s, but I\\'ll not have him wandering the camp like some stray dog... Occupy him for a time, then bring him to my tent.ROCHE: Sire, I must request an audience.HENSELT: Later. I\\'ll see my mages first, then the witcher.ZYVIK: Argh, just lovely. And here I\\'d hoped for a calm little war.GERALT: Know where I might wet my throat around here?ZYVIK: Roche, willin\\' to vouch for this overgrown urchin?ROCHE: He did not kill Foltest or Demavend if that\\'s what you\\'re asking. You\\'ve got my assurance on that.ZYVIK: Good enough for me. Let\\'s go, then.[Geralt can stop Zyvik and talk to him.]ZYVIK: Yes?I want to see the King now. GERALT: Take me to the King. I\\'ve seen enough military camps in my day.ZYVIK: That I cannot, witcher. I\\'m to keep an eye on you - the King\\'s orders.[AXII] Really want to babysit me? GERALT: Really want to babysit me?[FAILURE] ZYVIK: Don\\'t you try your witchcraft on me! I\\'m a competent corporal who follows orders![SUCCESS] ZYVIK: You\\'re right... let\\'s go.[If not convinced to take Geralt directly to Henselt, Zyvik shows Geralt around the camp.]ZYVIK: Our armorer... Busy as ever with military commissions, but he\\'ll take a private commission from time to time.ZYVIK: Ah, we\\'re here at last. The canteen - the most important place in the camp!ZYVIK: If you ever get bored, you should find a monster contract or two on the noticeboard.ZYVIK: Here\\'s where the King organizes tournaments. All glamour, ceremony, noses and cocks in the air. Between those, we kill time thrashing about with swords, pikes, chairs, the works. Good stuff - no holds barred.ZYVIK: They pay well, too, if you know who to talk to and who to bet on. Excuse me a moment, witcher...ZYVIK: How did the fight go?GUARD: You\\'ve a nose for this, Zyvik... You won again.ZYVIK: My gold.GUARD: You gonna bet on more fights today?ZYVIK: Course. I\\'ll come by later.ZYVIK: See him, witcher? Loosen his bonds a bit and he\\'s liable to jump at your throat like a rabid mutt.GERALT: One of Iorveth\\'s Scoia\\'tael? How did you capture him?ZYVIK: Scouts found him wounded in the ravines. Someone massacred a small unit. The boys said it was a bloodbath, as if the reaper just swung his scythe right through them. Whoever attacked them was very strong.GERALT: Any idea who it might\\'ve been?ZYVIK: No. But if they managed to ambush elves in the wild, I\\'d rather not meet them.GERALT: Right, Zyvik. Let\\'s go see the King.[Geralt and Zyvik approach the gate in the middle of camp.]ZYVIK: How\\'s it going lads?GUARD 1: I can\\'t feel me ploughing feet from all this standing around. Any chance you\\'ll be sending up some replacements?ZYVIK: In an hour... Open up the gate, the King wants to see the witcher.GUARD 1: Yeah, yeah...ZYVIK: Go straight to the royal tent. You can\\'t miss it. I\\'ve a few things to take care of.GERALT: Godspeed, Zyvik.ZYVIK: I\\'ll be near the main gate if you need me. So long.GUARD 1: Ha! A witcher!GUARD 2: The King must have summoned him to fight the wraiths.GUARD 1: You think?GUARD 2: I\\'m certain.GUARD 1: Ha, let\\'s see him deal with the Blood Curse.GUARD 2: Ten silver on the curse.GUARD 1: I wanted that bet.[Shilard is standing before King Henselt\\'s tent.]SHILARD: A ghastly mist and a witcher. What a coincidence.NILFGAARDIAN MAGE: Ethen mael dune, vatgharn.SHILARD: We shall se.[Shilard stops Geralt before he goes in.]SHILARD: Nearly everyone hunts you, yet you live in spite of that. Impressive.[If Aryan La Valette is alive] GERALT: I find it hard to wean myself off life.SHILARD: As do we all. However, in all my career as an ambassador of His Imperial Majesty, I have never met anyone quite as talented at surviving as you.SHILARD: I took the liberty of checking some rumors about you. I\\'ll say it again - impressive.[If Aryan La Valette is dead] GERALT: In no small part thanks to you, Excellency.SHILARD: I\\'ve helped you, yes. I trust I shan\\'t regret it.GERALT: As do I. I wouldn\\'t want to seem ungrateful.SHILARD: Are you seeking employment? I was unaware you fellows hired yourselves out for battle.GERALT: My aim here is different.SHILARD: Really? Perhaps I can be of assistance?What\\'re you doing here, Your Excellency? GERALT: What\\'s the emperor\\'s envoy doing here? Satisfy my curiosity.SHILARD: The last unfortunate conflict left the Northern Kingdoms in pitiful economic condition. His Imperial Majesty desires stability.SHILARD: We wish to offer financial assistance, so I\\'m visiting those lands hardest hit by the war.GERALT: Henselt is coping admirably as far as I can see.SHILARD: The details of my visit here are reserved for the Emperor and the Kaedweni king.I get it. GERALT: I understand. Matters so secret no one ought to know them... or something.[PERSUASION] Sure you can\\'t tell me something, Excellency? GERALT: You sure they\\'re that big a secret? I mean, they could be important to me.[FAILURE] SHILARD: They could also be relevant to the Empire\\'s security. You\\'ll learn nothing from me.[SUCCESS] SHILARD: I can reveal one thing. The Emperor was very moved to hear the White Wolf had returned. He asked me to investigate the matter personally and submit a report.GERALT: Why do I interest him?SHILARD: He didn\\'t say. His Imperial Majesty keeps his motivations to himself.[AXII] Tell me everything. GERALT: I need to know everything.SHILARD: Huh. Magic will not help you. I\\'m very well protected against such attempts.Shame about Foltest. GERALT: Foltest was a good king. Shame he ended that way.SHILARD: I\\'ve already conveyed the Emperor\\'s condolences to Constable Natalis.SHILARD: Since we\\'re talking about Temeria and Foltest... Apparently the fallen king\\'s advisor, the sorceress Triss Merigold, has disappeared in mysterious circumstances. Rumors abound... Do you know anything about her?GERALT: Why do you ask, Excellency?SHILARD: I heard the two of your are... close.That\\'s our business. GERALT: Witchers and sorceresses don\\'t generally share that kind of information.SHILARD: I understand it\\'s a delicate matter. All right, then, allow me to ask about something else.Mages sometimes disappear. GERALT: Mages have a natural tendency to disappear into thin air once in a while. Why is anyone concerned?SHILARD: Maybe they wonder if witchers, locked in dungeons, possess the same capacity. You\\'re avoiding the subject, which means it\\'s uncomfortable for you. Have it your way, I shan\\'t press. But I\\'ll ask one more question, if I may.GERALT: Of course, Your Excellency.SHILARD: I mentioned Triss because. I must admit, I am perturbed. Mages are known for their mutual envy and rivalry. I wonder if there\\'s any matter that could unite them?GERALT: Perhaps you could be a bit clearer, Excellency.SHILARD: Then I shall ask directly. Do you know anything about Merigold\\'s involvement with an organization of sorceresses?SHILARD: Assuming, of course, that you are, theoretically, or have been, close.Why does this interest you? GERALT: I\\'m not sure why the acquaintances of a sorceress would interest a Nilfgaardian ambassador.SHILARD: Many things interest me. Art, for example. A very interesting statuette was delivered to me today. A peculiar piece. Elusive, sensuous. It forces one to think. Even a monster slayer might not be indifferent to the beauty entrapped within.GERALT: Maybe. But I\\'m afraid I don\\'t have time to admire art.SHILARD: Do you have any other queries? I have some matters to which I must attend.She has her friends. GERALT: Maybe she\\'s involved, maybe she\\'s not. Triss has her friends and I have mine.SHILARD: Undoubtedly. Wandering poets, dwarves with terrorist contacts, and special forces agents.GERALT: It\\'s certainly true you diplomats are experts at gathering information.SHILARD: How else would we negotiate effectively? Learning all there is to learn about other countries is a necessity. Nevertheless, I thank you for your information. Was there anything else?I don\\'t do theory. GERALT: I\\'m a witcher, I rarely theorize. Killing monsters is purely practical.SHILARD: I don\\'t doubt it. Though sometimes a single understatement can speak more than a thousand words. So I thank you for your silence, witcher. Do you have other questions?GERALT: Why are you so interested in this organization of sorceresses?SHILARD: I wonder about some strange coincidences. I\\'m told several of them were seen in the vicinity when the assassination attempts occurred.GERALT: What\\'s so suspicious about that? Mages have always thronged around monarchs - the source of power and coin.SHILARD: I\\'m not accusing anyone. I merely said it makes me wonder.Where to next? GERALT: I saw you with Foltest before, now you\\'re with Henselt. No doubt you\\'ll visit the King of Redania next.SHILARD: I need not go far. Radovid is en route to Loc Muinne. Perhaps he has already arrived. We\\'ll meet there.GERALT: Loc Muinne? An ancient elven city, quite a ways away, near the source of the Pontar. Why there?SHILARD: The mages wish to reestablish their Council. They\\'ve sent out invitations to all the kings.[Geralt enters the king\\'s tent.]HENSELT: Come in, witcher. I wish you to feel at ease, as this is an unofficial audience... You helped me in the mist, thus I surmise you do not seek my death. Which leads me to ask what you do seek here, Geralt of Rivia?Peace and quiet - to clear my name. GERALT: Peace and quiet, Sire. I need to clear my name... Though I tend not to meddle in politics, this time I believe I have no choice.HENSELT: Mhm... You must answer quickly and unequivocally. You must be clear, witcher. I\\'m in no mood for excuses, hiding behind professional codes and trade secrets.HENSELT: Did you kill Foltest?GERALT: No.HENSELT: Do you know who did?[Same options to answer as below.]Justice. GERALT: Justice.HENSELT: A slippery thing, I\\'d say... It really depends on your point of view. So you claim you did not kill Foltest.HENSELT: Do you know who did?Yes. GERALT: A witcher named Letho.HENSELT: Do ya know each other?I don\\'t know. GERALT: I don\\'t know, I have amnesia. Letho has suggested he knows something about me. It\\'s possible we met before.HENSELT: There\\'s an old Kaedweni saying - a bitch will never bite another bitch. A hundred percent accurate where sorceresses are concerned.GERALT: To the matter at hand, Sire.No. GERALT: No.HENSELT: I was told you lost your memory. How can you know?GERALT: I can only say what I know to be certain. You wanted clarity, Sire.No. GERALT: I do not.HENSELT: Sadly for you, De Tansarville claims otherwise. One more lie and I shall have your head. Is that clear, witcher?GERALT: I know who held the dagger. I don\\'t know who ordered him to wield it. I thought you were asking about the latter, Sire.HENSELT: I asked you about a witcher who wears a snake medallion. Huge, bald...GERALT: His name is Letho.HENSELT: De Tansarville claims this Letho is in the area, is that true?GERALT: Yes.HENSELT: What does he want here? My head?GERALT: He\\'s hiding from Iorveth and his Scoia\\'tael. I don\\'t know his plans.HENSELT: And you aim to get him?GERALT: I do.HENSELT: Last question. Do you know who had Foltest and Demavend assassinated? Who\\'s behind the kingslayers?GERALT: I don\\'t know. But I\\'ll find out when I find Letho.HENSELT: My spies have confirmed your words. I suppose I must believe you.HENSELT: Now to the other matter - the mist, the wraiths, all that magic shit holding up my campaign. My mages, as usual, have proved useless. They blather on about higher magic, delayed curses and other hogwash, but nothin\\' comes of it.HENSELT: This matter must be settled with a sword. A witcher\\'s sword. Will you manage this task?I\\'ll manage. GERALT: Yeah, I\\'ll manage.I\\'ll try. GERALT: I\\'m wiling to try.HENSELT: Excellent. Lift the curse, and you\\'ll learn the meaning of royal generosity. And even should you fail to catch this Letho, I shall help you clear your name.HENSELT: Consider Dethmold at your disposal, he\\'ll give you all the necessary information. Also, you are free to move about the camp and its environs from now on.HENSELT: Now, leave me alone.What activated the curse? GERALT: The curse was cast three years ago. Any sign it\\'s been active in the interim?HENSELT: Is that important?GERALT: Sire, we\\'re not talking about a fortune told in a tent on market day, nor about some curse cast by a novice mage. This curse caused a solar eclipse and summoned hoards of specters.GERALT: We\\'re dealing with a complex spell that operates at several levels. Uncommon knowledge and skill were required to cast it. Lifting it will be even more difficult. If I\\'m going to deal with it, I need you to cooperate.HENSELT: Ah, the plague...! So be it.Sire, do you know who cast the curse? GERALT: As we forged our way through the fog, you claimed it was Glevissig\\'s curse...HENSELT: Sabrina Glevissig\\'s. She was a sorceress, my former advisor. I ordered her bound to a wagon wheel and burned alive. While dying, she cursed me and my lineage. That was three years ago.What activated the curse? GERALT: The curse was cast three years ago. Any sign it\\'s been active in the interim?HENSELT: My son was killed during a hunt.GERALT: Anything strange or unnatural occur at the time?HENSELT: A rabid boar ripped open his femoral artery. I witnessed it. An accident – nothing more.GERALT: The curse was activated today. I need to know why.HENSELT: As we negotiated, a fight broke out. I killed a priest of Kreve. Perhaps that...GERALT: Maybe...How exactly did Sabrina curse you? GERALT: Sire, do you remember the curse itself? What exactly did Sabrina say?HENSELT: All she said at the time has been fulfilled to some degree. A star adorned with a bloody braid will cut across the heavens. Square coins from maritime depths will beguile the hearts of fools.GERALT: Coins?HENSELT: Dethmold found a few such coins among soldiers accused of treason.What did you condemn Sabrina for? GERALT: What did you condemn Sabrina for, Sire?HENSELT: One year after the Peace of Cintra, I fought Demavend for Lormark. General Vandergrift commanded a part of my force. He forded the Pontar and joined battle on this field.HENSELT: It raged until evening, when Sabrina Glevissig decided to take matters into her own hands. Fireballs rained down onto the battlefield.HENSELT: Three thousand men turned to bloody, charred meat scraps. The fire consumed Kaedwenis and Aedirnians alike. Knights boiled alive in their armor - mad beasts howling with pain.HENSELT: War is for the honorable. When the likes of Glevissig enter the fray, it turns into hell.Why did Sabrina attack her own side? GERALT: What drove Sabrina to attack her own army? Any specific reason?HENSELT: I\\'ve heard none. Not even speculation. She was my advisor, a member of the Council of Mages. For years I was forced to tolerate her excesses, schemes, court scandals...GERALT: Was she loyal?HENSELT: Hah! Only to herself.  5.02 - DETHMOLD\\'S BLOOD CURSE BRIEFING < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[As Geralt leaves Henselt\\'s tent, Dethmold calls out to him.]DETHMOLD: Witcher, a word, if you will.DETHMOLD: You have no idea how delighted I am to work in tandem with you.GERALT: True, I have no idea.DETHMOLD: Better times approach, Geralt, you shall see. I trust you\\'re not bothered if I refer to you by name?GERALT: Not at all.DETHMOLD: Wonderful! I feel we shall become great friends...Time will tell. GERALT: That remains to be seen.DETHMOLD: Shake my hand, Geralt. To mark the beginning of our friendship! Don\\'t worry, I\\'ve no poison needle up my sleeve...Have it your way. DETHMOLD: I believe one can learn much about a man from his handshake.GERALT: Learned anything?DETHMOLD: You have the handshake of a warrior - strong, decisive, dominating. You\\'re the conquering type. The kind women love...GERALT: I was asking about the curse.DETHMOLD: Ah! Of course! What would you like to know?Let\\'s get to work. GERALT: I\\'m not looking for new friends, Dethmold. Let\\'s get to work.DETHMOLD: I see... As you seem to be the hero, how might I help you, White Wolf?Why is Henselt still alive? GERALT: Why is Henselt still breathing? He killed the priest - why didn\\'t he burst like a ripe tomato under a dwarf\\'s heel?DETHMOLD: Perhaps Glevissig wishes Henselt to wait for imminent death?GERALT: I don\\'t think so. I know a few sorceresses. They\\'re mean, true, but they also want results. Sabrina cast the curse while roasting at the stake. Not the most comfortable circumstances. I suspect she botched something.DETHMOLD: Are you suggesting Henselt may be safe?GERALT: I\\'m suggesting he could be saved. Provided we cut him off from the heart of the curse - the battle of specters. It\\'s the weakest link.DETHMOLD: How could we do that?GERALT: I don\\'t know yet. But I suspect I could summon Sabrina\\'s ghost and force her to free Henselt. First, I need to learn the circumstances of her death.A blood curse usually requires blood... GERALT: If I\\'m not mistaken, you need blood to cast a blood curse.DETHMOLD: Precisely – unachievable otherwise.GERALT: Sabrina was bound to a wagon wheel. Where did she get enough blood?DETHMOLD: She put a spell on a soldier, who gave her a coup de grace. It was easy, the minds of some soldiers are so uncomplicated... Sabrina needed one of them to strike her, shorten her suffering but complete the curse. However, this is where she erred! That whore performed miracles, gathered the Power, got the prophecy and activator right, but fell flat on her face on the simplest thing at the end!GERALT: Don\\'t get so excited.DETHMOLD: She chose a fool, a bungler. I heard he thrust five times with his spear, yet the witch\\'s soul would not quit her corpse.GERALT: There was no one guarding the pyre?DETHMOLD: It was one of the guards the sorceress chose for the task. His comrades were irate – he spoiled the show for them. The King was no longer anywhere near.GERALT: In any case, blood flowed and the curse took root.DETHMOLD: Yes, but the harlot got her due.Not all the specters were aggressive. Did you notice that? GERALT: Did you notice that not all the specters were aggressive?DETHMOLD: Mm... Most would disappear when we neared them.GERALT: I think the curse\\'s power corrupts the ghosts of those who died in the battle, turning them into draugirs.DETHMOLD: Draugirs? Is that some professional name you witchers have for specters?GERALT: They\\'re demons, Dethmold. Draugirs are demons of war that arise on battlefields where the fighting was vicious and the slaughter particularly bloody. They are hatred and blood lust in condensed form.DETHMOLD: The name matters little. Do you know how to rid us of these draugirs?GERALT: A silver sword\\'s enough to send them to their rest. But as long as the curse remains active, new ones will appear. The soldiers\\' ghosts are the key. If we could reverse the tide of the battle...DETHMOLD: Don\\'t delay! Grab your sword and start reversing...GERALT: I\\'ll need some symbols of war that belonged to the soldiers who perished here. Artifacts symbolizing hatred, death, courage and faith. They have to be magically active and linked to those who died. Without them, I won\\'t be able to summon the ghosts.DETHMOLD: Well I\\'ve no idea how to find them. Apart from which, I know little about war symbolism...GERALT: I\\'ll deal with the artifacts. I have another job for you.Lifted any curses before? GERALT: Have you dealt with curses before?DETHMOLD: I\\'ve cast a few in my time. One victim sprouted donkey\\'s ears and a tail, another\\'s house burned down... Nothing too serious.GERALT: Shame... Have you removed curses, lifted spells?DETHMOLD: Never had the chance. But I mastered the theory involved – best in my class at the magic academy.GERALT: They don\\'t teach you about curses like this one at Ban Ard.DETHMOLD: Glevissig\\'s curse is a fourth-level blood spell. It\\'s also known as the \"Arch Mistress\\'s curse.\" A misnomer, for they have been cast by generally crazed mages or priests, not necessarily women.GERALT: You\\'ve done your homework.How does a blood curse work? GERALT: Explain this blood curse to me.DETHMOLD: An ordinary blood curse is a trivial thing. You let a little of your own blood – best done at midnight, surrounded by lit candles.GERALT: Sabrina had a whole pyre around her. Tell me about Glevissig\\'s curse.DETHMOLD: Read about it for yourself, I\\'ve all the necessary literature. In fact, you only need the \"Great Encyclopedia of Curses, Spells and Prophecies\" and a volume compiled by Tissaia de Vries and Margarita Laux-Antille - \"Masters of Magic on Curses - Selected Writings.\"All right. I\\'ll read them. GERALT: Quite a tome...I don\\'t have time to read. GERALT: I\\'m not going to waste my time reading. Tell me the important bits.DETHMOLD: Oh... Oh, no need to be ashamed, Geralt. In these times few get the opportunity to learn the arts of reading and writing. Illiteracy is...GERALT: I can read, mage. Time\\'s a-wasting – are you gonna start helping me?DETHMOLD: The effects and phenomena generated by a fourth level blood curse require an immense amount of the Power. The eclipse, the death of a dynasty, the battle of specters... No sorcerer, no living being, can summon such levels of energy. It\\'s quite simply impossible.GERALT: But some clever mages discovered how to make possible the impossible. Since then the world has lived in fear of your curses. Genius. What did you discover?DETHMOLD: A prophecy that initiates a blood curse is simply a spell that binds the Power. It should be cast at a site possessing the appropriate accumulation characteristics.DETHMOLD: A battlefield is perfect: blood-soaked ground, defined boundaries, a symbolic dimension. When the caster utters the words of the prophecy, the curse begins to accumulate the Power. For the last three years – day after day, month after month – the initiating curse has been gathering the Power, drawing it from the elements of fire, earth, air and water.DETHMOLD: The energy thus accumulated could move the stars...DETHMOLD: Enter the activator – one of the prophesied events, possessing its own symbolic dimension. It releases the accumulated energy for use by the curse proper. Ordinarily, the curse cannot utilize all the built up Power, which must be released in some way. So one gets side effects, like solar eclipses...Are you sure Sabrina cast the curse? GERALT: Are you sure Sabrina cast the curse?DETHMOLD: Positively. Curses of this kind are cast rarely. There have only been six confirmed cases.GERALT: How many confirmed cases of their being lifted?DETHMOLD: One. By a team of mages led by Arch Mistress Francesca Findabair, whence came the curse\\'s other appelation. In any case, Sabrina Glevissig was part of that team...GERALT: Small world. And one that just got a little uglier.DETHMOLD: That\\'s not all. The curse that Francesca and Sabrina dealt with was meant to end the lives of the last of the Thyssen dynasty, the rulers of Kovir. It was cast by Scarlet Rodallega... A very talented, but completely mad man. A prophecy and an activator were also involved.GERALT: I see. Sabrina just stole her curse from this Rodallega.DETHMOLD: Precisely. Besides which, the King himself and a company of armed men witnessed her casting it.What\\'s with the coins? GERALT: We\\'ve got our comet and murder. What about the coins?DETHMOLD: We have those as well. Not enough for you?GERALT: No. Why do I get the feeling I\\'ve stumbled on some shameful secret?DETHMOLD: A state secret.GERALT: If you don\\'t tell me, your head of state may soon lose his head...DETHMOLD: There\\'s a plot afoot within the military. Those involved share a symbol – a square coin adorned with a fish. Let\\'s do this: I shall in no way hinder your investigation and you will reveal to me anything you learn. Should I happen upon anything related to the curse...GERALT: You\\'ll let me know. So be it.Let\\'s get to work. GERALT: You\\'re gonna help me, Dethmold.DETHMOLD: Of course, as the King ordered.GERALT: Listen up. You\\'ll do the paperwork - I get the feeling you like it. I\\'ll need a number of protective runes to summon Sabrina\\'s ghost.GERALT: They need to detain the sorceress\\' ghost and anything else that enters this world with it. Find something for me in your library. The runes need to be easy to produce – I haven\\'t seen any artists around here.GERALT: Apart from that, the draugirs are likely to begin their forays in search of Henselt. When they leave the battlefield, they\\'ll grow weaker. Your men should be able to handle them. Just equip them with silver-plated weapons.GERALT: Henselt could also use something silver to defend himself. Over the entrance to his tent, hang a wreath of cinquefoil and fool\\'s parsley. Inside, a fire fueled by juniper branches must burn at all times.DETHMOLD: Where will I get so much silver?GERALT: Melt down your collection of pots, for all I care. Just get it.DETHMOLD: Those aren\\'t pots! They\\'re silver vases of Nazair!GERALT: Last of all: give Henselt an instructional talk, explain that I\\'ll need him.DETHMOLD: And what will you be doing? Drinking ale and fondling the camp women?GERALT: There\\'s that, yes, though I\\'ll also prepare to summon Sabrina\\'s ghost and figure out what I need to send the fighting specters back to the afterlife. I\\'ll drop by and give you more work as I learn about this curse.DETHMOLD: How did you divine that you might recover your memory by lifting the curse?Someone foretold it. GERALT: The only diviner I\\'ve ever trusted told me.DETHMOLD: Interesting. That being?GERALT: A drunkard and fool in love. He\\'s dead. But keep your nose out of my past.How do you know? GERALT: I don\\'t like people poking around in my life...DETHMOLD: Learning about others is my job. I must know the secrets of all who wish to approach the King. I\\'ve no problem admitting I like the work.GERALT: My past has nothing to do with Henselt.DETHMOLD: You don\\'t know that. Do you know why I have no friends, witcher? Because sooner or later I learn all their secrets. Which is followed by interrogations, torture, executions.GERALT: Just leave my past alone.GERALT: See you.  5.03 - CONSPIRACY THEORY: INFORMATION GATHERING < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt begins his quest by gathering information around the camp, starting with the soldiers.]SOLDIER 1: What do you want?First war for you? GERALT: This your first war?SOLDIER 1: Not a chance! We soldiers never want for work under Henselt.How\\'s morale? GERALT: How\\'s the mood?SOLDIER 1: Food and drink are good and the ploughing tent\\'s well staffed. Fightin\\' men don\\'t really need anything more.Think you can win this war? GERALT: Think you\\'ll win?SOLDIER 1: That Aedirnian rabble don\\'t stand a chance.SOLDIER 2: What is it?Is this your first war? GERALT: You\\'re young. This your first excursion?SOLDIER 2: Aye. I\\'m itchin\\' for that battle.GERALT: Hmm... Young and zealous. Not afraid?SOLDIER 2: Of who? Short arses led by a lass? We\\'ll thrash \\'em.Expecting support from Nilfgaard? GERALT: I heard the Nilfgaardian force is going to support you.SOLDIER 2: Oh, yeah? The Nilfgaardians yap a lot, demand even more, but when it comes to fighting, they slink away.I\\'m looking for a whore. GERALT: I heard there are some lovely ladies around here.SOLDIER 2: I heard the same.GERALT: Only heard?SOLDIER 2: Left me fiancée at home. Gave me word I\\'d be true.SOLDIER 3: What d\\'you want?Food any good in the camp? GERALT: They feed you well here?SOLDIER 3: Depends. One day be heaps of meat, the next straight grits without one pork drippin\\'. Still, we fill our stomachs with what the foe has in his stores.Any idea what the Nilfgaardians want? GERALT: Any idea what Nilfgaardian forces are doing here?SOLDIER 3: Ah, who the hell knows?! I reckon they\\'re just observin\\', and nothin\\' good will come o\\' that.GERALT: Think they\\'ve made a deal with Henselt?SOLDIER 3: They\\'ve been here weeks, so they must\\'ve agreed on something. The camp folk don\\'t like it.I have a feeling I\\'m being followed. GERALT: I think I\\'m being followed.SOLDIER 3: Very likely.GERALT: Who is it, and why?SOLDIER 3: Dethmold\\'s men, they\\'re everywhere. Word is they\\'re onto some plot, but that\\'s all I know.SOLDIER 4: What do you want?Why are the Nilfgaardians here? GERALT: What are the Nilfgaardian forces doing here?SOLDIER 4: I dunno. Their presence disgusts some, but I\\'m glad to see them here.GERALT: Why\\'s that?SOLDIER 4: I\\'d rather they be with us than with Aedirn.Where was Sabrina executed? GERALT: I heard that Sabrina Glevissig was burned at the stake somewhere nearby.SOLDIER 4: Upon a hill. Folk congregate there to this day.GERALT: What for?SOLDIER 4: They say it brings luck, but I don\\'t buy that superstitious shite.I\\'ve seen some Temerians around here. GERALT: Why do you think the Temerians are here?SOLDIER 4: I\\'ve not the faintest idea. And I don\\'t trust that captain o\\' theirs.GERALT: You know Roche?SOLDIER 4: Not personally, but I heard he\\'s a madman, something terrible. Folk by the campfire claim he cuts off elves\\' ears and eats them.[Geralt talks to the relic seller in the canteen.]RELIC SELLER: Relics, artifacts, trinkets and talismans – hallowed and highly valuable!I\\'m looking for items belonging to those who died in the battle three years ago... GERALT: I\\'m interested in objects that belonged to the soldiers who perished in the battle three years ago. Not any old things. They have to be magically active. I know how to check.RELIC SELLER: That\\'s not my speciality, witcher. I deal in relics.[Geralt meets the mercenary Adam Pangratt in the camp.]PANGRATT: Need some help, monster slayer?GERALT: I want to talk, dog of war.PANGRATT: I\\'ve heard much about you, witcher. Greetings.GERALT: Greetings, captain.What are your orders? GERALT: Is Henselt paying you to wait?PANGRATT: Curiosity itchin\\' you, witcher? Not the best trait to have in wartime.GERALT: You don\\'t have to tell me if you don\\'t want to.PANGRATT: Dethmold\\'s given us silver-plated weapons and protective amulets - on your advice, as I heard it. We\\'re to observe the mist and, if need be, drive off the wraiths.How many men you got? GERALT: How many mercenaries you got watching the fog?PANGRATT: I\\'ve got them spread out in small groups, around campfires. And how many we number, well, that\\'s my concern alone.Have you noticed the mist spreading? GERALT: Since you\\'re already watching it, pay attention to the size of the cloud. I need to know if it\\'s expanding. PANGR: Well...GERALT: How fast?PANGRATT: It\\'s almost imperceptible, but it\\'s constant. A foot, perhaps two a day... What does that mean?GERALT: Means I have to hurry.How much is Henselt paying you? GERALT: Does Henselt pay his mercenaries well? Call it professional curiosity on my part.PANGRATT: It\\'s no secret - a lump sum of twenty thousand Novigrad crowns awaits. To be divvied up between those who survive.GERALT: So the more of you die, the greater the take per head.PANGRATT: Yes.Were you here three years ago? GERALT: Were you here three years ago, during the last battle for Vergen?PANGRATT: Bradley\\'s Blue Banner was. They were decimated by mages. The survivors enlisted with us. They weren\\'t eager to talk about it, and we didn\\'t press \\'em.GERALT: No lack of work for your kind...PANGRATT: Mercenary might just be the surest profession these days. Sign of the times.You\\'re famous... GERALT: I heard you gained fame during the wars with Nilfgaard.PANGRATT: Our fees have doubled since the Battle of Brenna. As it turns out, it was worth risking our necks.How did the Battle of Brenna play out? GERALT: I wouldn\\'t mind learning some details about Brenna from someone who played first fiddle there.PANGRATT: Constable Natalis commanded the Nordlings. The Nilfgaardians mounted a vicious attack, and if not for us and the Dun Banner, the collected armies of the North probably would\\'ve shattered into bits. Luckily, we showed up at the right time, withstood the assault and came out victorious.PANGRATT: We earned every last copper we were paid. Fifty thousand Nilfgaardians shattered their teeth trying to bite at us. Menno Coehoorn, their commander in chief, chose death over humiliation. Like in every battle it was a question of timing, taking advantage of the foe\\'s missteps, and a bit of luck.And you\\'ve been fighting since then? GERALT: Must be fatiguing - fighting all the time.PANGRATT: I took a little time off recently, somethin\\' along the lines of a honeymoon, but I like my craft and I\\'m not afraid to admit it.I once knew a female mercenary. GERALT: I knew one of your kind once. Woman by the name of Rayla.PANGRATT: Killed by an elf\\'s treacherous arrow. She made a mistake - let her emotions take control. This profession requires cold calculation.[Geralt checks with the brothel madame, Carole.]CAROLE: Well, well, a witcher. Girls, prim yourselves! How can I help you, handsome?Talk to me. GERALT: I wanted to talk.CAROLE: We\\'re no strangers to the art of conversation, but it\\'ll cost you just as much as a good plough.No way. GERALT: I\\'m not gonna pay for conversation.Fine. GERALT: Sounds all right.CAROLE: Ask away, then. What would you like to talk about?How are things in the camp? GERALT: Anything interesting going on in the camp?CAROLE: Soldiers are scared shitless what with this battle approaching. They\\'d rather drink themselves silly than let us honest whores make some coin. Is that interesting? I doubt it.GERALT: Not raring to fight, are they?CAROLE: They might\\'ve been eager at first, but the longer we sit here, the less lively they become. Fighting\\'s like ploughing - lust for one and you lust for the other.What do you know about Henselt? GERALT: I wouldn\\'t mind knowing what you think of Henselt.CAROLE: I\\'m a madame. What can I know about the King?GERALT: I seem to remember that madames and innkeepers know everything.CAROLE: He used to come here to plough. To develop a camaraderie with the fighting men, like. But that was just a phase. Most likely only ploughs sweet-smelling ladies now.Any thoughts on the Virgin of Aedirn? GERALT: Heard of the Virgin of Aedirn?CAROLE: Hasn\\'t everyone?GERALT: Any thoughts?CAROLE: Oh, yes. A maturing woman like that never been ploughed? Her head\\'s bound to be muddled. We\\'ll have peace when she drops her sword to grab a nice healthy prick instead.[Geralt talks to Zyvik.]ZYVIK: What d\\'you want, witcher?I\\'m curious about the last Battle of Vergen. GERALT: Did you participate in the battle?ZYVIK: I did, and I fought... But I\\'d rather not go into it.GERALT: The spirits of those who died in battle are now in combat on that field. They kill each other and change into nasty creatures called draugirs. Aedirnians, Kaedwenis, even your comrades... I want to help them, but I have to know what happened during the battle.ZYVIK: Oh the plague, listen then!ZYVIK: The fighting started in the afternoon. The Dun Banner was first to attack. We were ambushed, cut off from our main unit and devastated... Bloody scouts and Sabrina Glevissig, who was supposed to mind the battlefield...ZYVIK: By then, the battle was in full swing. Wherever you see those damned furrows... people fought there. The Aedirnian lines faltered a few times, but we couldn\\'t crush them because of Seltkirk...ZYVIK: Yes, we had the Visitor, they had Seltkirk of Gulet, the invincible white knight, Aedirn\\'s finest swordsman. Wherever our forces gained the upper hand, he\\'d appear and reverse the fighting\\'s course.ZYVIK: Then Vandergrift himself went into battle. He met Seltkirk in the middle of the melee. It was a battle of titans. In the end, the Visitor hacked Seltkirk and sliced the white knight from his head to his balls.ZYVIK: Then death fell from the heavens. Lumps of burning soil flew through the air, the whole valley was on fire... Damned magic of a damned witch!ZYVIK: I owe my life to Priest Chrest, our chaplain. He led me out of the battle and went back for the others. He had a medallion that protected him against fire. He led everyone out, including the Aedirnians, but the flames got him in the end.How did the battle start? GERALT: What happened before the battle?ZYVIK: We forded the Pontar on the third day after the autumn equinox. The Aedirnians were waiting for us, formed up in a long line at the foot of those hills. I remember the banners of Vengerberg, Aldersberg, Gulet... Knights, armored infantry, peasants, the Vergen dwarf regiment... All save the King. They numbered more than five thousand.ZYVIK: General Vandergrift, commander of the Kaedwenis, had less than four thousand, including the elite Bearheads, armored troops from Ard Carraigh, and the famous White Foxes of the North. And ourselves, the Dun Banner, veterans of Brenna, hated by the Aedirnians more than the plague.ZYVIK: But above all, we had Vandergrift the Visitor. Maybe he was a bastard, but he knew war like nobody else.Did you see the duel between Seltkirk and the Visitor? GERALT: Did you see the duel between Seltkirk and Vandergrift?ZYVIK: From a distance. At the time I was on that hill and they were somewhere over there. The field used to be as flat as a table...ZYVIK: It was their second duel. Earlier, in peace time, they\\'d met at a tournament in Ard Carraigh. Seltkirk won then. Vandergrift\\'s sword cracked and the Visitor had to yield. After the tournament, he had a new sword forged by Kaedwen\\'s best mages and swordsmiths. That\\'s how \"Loa\\'then\" came to be.GERALT: I think that means \"hatred\" in the elder language - pretty pretentious.ZYVIK: They say a sorcerer cast a spell on the sword and told Vandergrift the blade wouldn\\'t crack as long as he remained invincible... The mage got fifty lashes and was the last to mention any such nonsense.GERALT: Who has Vandergrift\\'s sword, now?ZYVIK: When the sea of flames died out, the looters ran amok. They found Seltkirk\\'s chainmail, which survived somehow. Maybe it was magical, too... Vandergrift\\'s sword went missing. The boys in the camp claim the female dragonslayer has it. But I wouldn\\'t even try talking to her...GERALT: Who\\'s got Seltkirk\\'s chainmail?ZYVIK: Er... A certain Vinson Traut. Low nobility, in the army since forever, a greedy bastard.GERALT: Where can I find him?ZYVIK: That\\'s a problem. Dethmold wanted him arrested after they found a square coin on him. Some of the officers and noblemen want to get rid of the Black Ones. They don\\'t like how they lord it around the camp, even that the King talks to them. Those coins are their sign, the stupid bunch of plotters...ZYVIK: Anyway, Vinson\\'s a swashbuckler, he thrashed Dethmold\\'s people and disappeared. Those with the coins won\\'t say a word because they\\'re scared of Dethmold.You served in the Dun Banner. GERALT: Do I have this right? You served in the Dun Banner?ZYVIK: Did, indeed. Henselt\\'s never commanded a fiercer group of warriors. And he never will. If not for us, there\\'d have been no victory for the North at Brenna. We carried the day.GERALT: I didn’t see the Dun Banner in the camp.ZYVIK: And you won\\'t. The unit\\'s no more... Ensign Ekhart Henessy carried the standard into battle for the last time three years ago.GERALT: Glevissig\\'s magic?ZYVIK: Worse. The Aedirnian troops, the bastards. The Dun Banner, the pride of Kaedwen, lost its standard and almost all its men. The Visitor refused to send us reinforcements when we were cut off. The Dun must prevail. It\\'s been in worse shite than this. The Dun will be all right. Seven Aedirnians to each one of us. We had no fucking hope.ZYVIK: Two hundred men went into battle and less than seventy came back. But that\\'s not all... only a few survive to this day.ZYVIK: The boys couldn\\'t handle it... suicide, fire-water, fisstech. A few became highwaymen. They ended up on the gallows or in ditches... Memories can also kill you, and soldiers don\\'t always deal with them well.GERALT: I have to find that standard.ZYVIK: I heard it lies in the catacombs \\'neath Vergen, alongside my mates. Hey, if you\\'re thinking of going there, I oughta give you my beaver skin cap. That\\'s it\\'s rightful place.Did Chrest\\'s medallion disappear with him? GERALT: You mentioned the Priest.ZYVIK: A really good man. He was with us the whole time - during the march, in the barracks and in battle... Among common soldiers... Freya gave him a medallion to protect him from fire. I don\\'t know how true that is, but he led me and many others to safety.GERALT: Who has this medallion?ZYVIK: King Henselt. I saw it once. I don\\'t know how he got hold of it, but he definitely had it.Any memories of the Battle of Brenna? GERALT: Were you at Brenna?ZYVIK: Ah, yes... Cut down more Black Ones there than anywhere else. The Redanians were in disarray on the left when we joined the battle. Same with the Temerian regiments in the middle. We arrived just in time. Menno Coehoorn commanded the Nilfgaardians... He was some leader. Even we feared him like fire, but somehow we prevailed.GERALT: What happened to him afterwards?ZYVIK: He refused to flee, died like many others. Though no one knows who did it and no one ever found his corpse.Thanks Zyvik, you helped me. GERALT: Thanks, Zyvik.[Geralt can check back in with Dethmold about the things he\\'s learned.]GERALT: We need to talk.DETHMOLD: What? No \\'hello\\', \\'good morning\\', \\'pucker up and kiss my arse\\'? Nothing?GERALT: Uh, hello.DETHMOLD: Good morning, White Wolf. Will you take some tea? It\\'s a fortifying beverage.GERALT: Some other time, maybe.Have you spoken to the King? GERALT: Spoken to the King yet?DETHMOLD: Indeed. He was delighted to hear he can be \\'cut\\' from the curse.GERALT: Great, because I need the medallion of the priest known as Chrest. I heard it\\'s in Henselt\\'s possession.DETHMOLD: He\\'ll give you nothing until you free him from the curse. Truthfully, I believe I understand him. You\\'ve a good chance of perishing when you confront the draugirs...GERALT: Give me a break, Dethmold. The two of you are just afraid I\\'ll leave this entire mess in your hands.DETHMOLD: Ah, that is something I do not fear at all, for I know exactly why you\\'re here. As for the King... You may curse him and scold him and call him a fool if you wish, though it\\'s not something I would advise.Learned anything new about the curse? GERALT: Learn anything new about the curse?DETHMOLD: A mage on the other side of the fog is also probing the battlefield... A sorceress.GERALT: How do you know?DETHMOLD: \"You shall know them by the fruit of their spells...\" Magic differs with the brain type that generates it. The female mind is simply laid out differently.GERALT: It could be Triss...DETHMOLD: No, witcher, it\\'s someone far more powerful.  5.04 - THE BUTCHER OF CIDARIS < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Outside the canteen, Geralt witnesses an argument between two men.]SVEN: Leave me be, father!MANFRED: Leave ya be?! Your life\\'s at stake! Why, your mother will have my head if anythin\\' happens to ya!SVEN: NO! This is about my honor! And plough what Mother does to you. I\\'ll practice, I must prepare.[Geralt finds the father in the canteen, slumped over the table.]MANFRED: Why didn\\'t he turn out like his mum? Must my devilish blood course so quickly through his veins?MANFRED: Why did he have to be like me? Stubborn imbecile...MANFRED: Goin\\' to the slaughter like a pig for a feast. And there\\'s naught I can do...GERALT: Mind if I join you?MANFRED: Think I\\'ve the right to stop you from taking a free stool?GERALT: No right, but you might not want company while you drink.MANFRED: And why might you want to drink with me?I need some help.GERALT: Always better to talk business over a tankard. Let me buy a round.MANFRED: All the same to me.GERALT: Getting sad drunk?MANFRED: Mm-hm... My son\\'s decided to kill himself.I don\\'t like to drink alone.GERALT: I prefer to drink in good company.MANFRED: Doesn\\'t ring true. You don\\'t even know me.GERALT: That\\'s true, but I know a good man when I see him. So?MANFRED: Do what you will. Everyone does what they want. My son, for instance, has decided to die.MANFRED: He\\'s decided to duel Letande Avet, known as the Butcher of Cidaris. All in all, that makes him a dead man.Who is Letande? GERALT: Letande Avet? Who\\'s that?MANFRED: A killer.GERALT: Plenty of those in the army.MANFRED: No! Killing enemies is not the same as slaughtering your own countrymen. The Butcher likes the latter and he\\'s good at it. The best.This is going to be a duel? GERALT: They\\'re going to duel, to the death?MANFRED: Are you that ignorant? We\\'ve been sittin\\' here for weeks. Nothin\\' is happenin\\', and Henselt don\\'t like that. So he\\'s organized some diversions.GERALT: You mean tournaments.MANFRED: Nothing like tournaments, more like murders - mock battles without the mocking. The duelers rarely leave the arena on their own two feet. When our unit learned that sixth company was puttin\\' forward the Butcher of Cidaris there were no volunteers. So we drew straws and it fell to Sven.GERALT: He can\\'t back out?MANFRED: He can, but he won\\'t. I\\'ve pleaded, I\\'ve begged, but my son\\'s a stubborn one. The pup\\'s got \\'honor.\\' But what good\\'s honor to a corpse?Let me help you. GERALT: What if I helped you?MANFRED: What kind of question is that?GERALT: Could I count on you in return?MANFRED: Save my son and there won\\'t be a thing I wouldn\\'t do to aid you.GERALT: I take that as your vow. Where\\'s Sven?MANFRED: Training in front of the canteen, near the mercenaries\\' tent. You\\'ll know him when you see him.[Geralt finds Sven practicing where his father said he would be.]GERALT: Are you Sven?SVEN: Who\\'s asking?GERALT: Somebody who just might save your ass.SVEN: Piss off!Stop playing the hero. GERALT: I wouldn\\'t play the hero if I were you.SVEN: You don\\'t know me.GERALT: I spoke to your father.SVEN: Ah. I\\'ll wager he told you the sad story of Sven, who needs to be rescued.GERALT: I\\'m no wandering knight and you\\'re no princess in distress.Watch what you say, kid. GERALT: Never speak to me that way again.SVEN: Why? Will you beat me? I\\'m to fight the Butcher - I piss on your threats.[Continues same as \"I promised someone I\\'d help you.\"]I promised someone I\\'d help you. GERALT: I promised your father I\\'d help you.SVEN: Then go back and ask his pardon for tricking him.GERALT: Will you feel better when they kill you?SVEN: I\\'ll certainly feel worse if I cower out.GERALT: I\\'m the last one who\\'d ask you to do that.SVEN: What will you do? Summon the Butcher and send him out on an urgent mission to deflower the Virgin of Aedirn?GERALT: No, we\\'ll fight as a pair against Letande and his second. Your honor will remain untouched, like a twelve-year-old nun\\'s petal.SVEN: Why do you wish to help me?That\\'s my business. GERALT: Don\\'t ask me to explain myself. Now wave that sword around some more. We both need you to practice.I promised your father I would. GERALT: I told you. Your father asked me.SVEN: And you courteously agreed? Is that so?GERALT: Yes.SVEN: You lie.GERALT: What difference does it make? Really?I like to level the chances... GERALT: I\\'m not a fan of uneven fights.SVEN: How much did he pay you?GERALT: Your father could never afford my fee.[Geralt goes to look for Letande.]GERALT: I\\'m looking for Letande Avet, the Butcher of Cidaris.LETANDE: What do you seek?An opponent. GERALT: I want to try my luck.LETANDE: Strange. Most shit themselves at the sight of my sword.GERALT: They say you\\'re equal to a witcher in a fight.LETANDE: They lie. I\\'m better.GERALT: We\\'ll see.LETANDE: You\\'ll need to wait, I\\'ve a fight lined up already.GERALT: We could always duel in pairs. I look around and I see the cream of Kaedweni knights. Someone\\'s bound to agree.EDWIN: I am Edwin Leistham, known also as the \\'The Petal.\\' If Letande will have me, I\\'ll gladly stand at his side.LETANDE: Why do they call you \\'The Petal\\'? I\\'ve no need for one who ploughs maidens simply for the pleasure of deflowering them...EDWIN: You offend me greatly, Letande. I owe the moniker to the fact that I place flower petals in the mouths of the foes I defeat.LETANDE: I\\'ll be glad to see anything stuffed in the witcher\\'s mouth. So be it.You\\'re a cowardly bastard. GERALT: I\\'m looking for the coward. Heard he picks fights with youngsters who have yet to start shaving...LETANDE: What did you say?GERALT: He\\'s a coward and a poser. You know him?LETANDE: I am him. And consider yourself dead, wanderer.GERALT: We\\'ll meet in the arena.LETANDE: Yes, in the arena. Hey, Leistham, you\\'ll be my second. We shall duel in pairs.GERALT: See you.[Geralt returns to Sven.]SVEN: And? Has he agreed?GERALT: Yes.SVEN: Some whoreson, eh?GERALT: Unique among them. Ready?SVEN: Uh-huh.I need to get ready. GERALT: Give me a minute.No time to lose. GERALT: Let\\'s go get \\'em.MAREK: Most gracious King, noble lords, men at arms... Shortly, in the arena, you shall witness the famed Letande Avet, known also as the Butcher of Cidaris, at whose side shall stand the honorable Edwin \\'The Petal\\' Leistham.MAREK: Opposing them are Sven of.... somewhere and Geralt of Rivia - witcher!MAREK: May the gods favor the better men! Begin![If Sven does not survive the duel] MAREK: Hail to the victor! Glory to the vanquished! The next tournament will take place in the coming days, to be announced by the Royal Herald! Long live our Gracious Lord Henselt, King of Kaedwen![Geralt meets Manfred afterwards.]MANFRED: I knew it would end this way.GERALT: I\\'m sorry.MANFRED: You did all you could. All I have left is to bury my son and explain his death to his mother...GERALT: Mm...MANFRED: What payment do you demand?GERALT: I failed to save Sven.MANFRED: Yet you tried. I\\'ll not be called an ingrate.GERALT: Very well. I need to learn about the people who carry square coins.MANFRED: Why do you need this knowledge?GERALT: Sorry, I can\\'t tell you.MANFRED: All right. This coin belonged to my son. Take it and go to Madame Carole\\'s brothel. Ask for Whistling Wendy. The madame will take you to the whore\\'s tent and leave you alone with her. When Wendy asks you what you wish, tell her you would like her smile to open the gates of paradise.GERALT: Thank you.MANFRED: You might chance upon Vinson Traut among the conspirators. Be wary, he\\'s an evil man, very dangerous too. They say he\\'s protected by magic armor. Even you could have a problem with him.[If Sven and Geralt both survive] MAREK: Hail to the victor! Glory to the vanquished! The prize in the contest was a noble title. Our gracious and merciful ruler, King Henselt, shall generously bestow this upon the young Sven. Heralds will announce the subsequent duels. Long live King Henselt, long live Kaedwen![Geralt exits the arena and meets Sven and Manfred.]SVEN: Thank you. You salvaged my honor.MANFRED: He salvaged that foolish head of yours.SVEN: I\\'m a knight now! The King himself will do the honors!MANFRED: You were born in a pig sty, where the labor came to your mother eighteen springs ago. Nothin\\'ll change that. Witcher, I said you could demand what you will, and my word\\'s no worse than a noble\\'s.SVEN: You demanded payment for helping me...?Nothing\\'s ever free. GERALT: Everything has its price.MANFRED: What is it you wish?GERALT: Information on those who carry square coins.SVEN: Father!MANFRED: Silence! Why do you need to know?[Same options to continue as below.]Butt out. GERALT: This is between your father and me.SVEN: Who do you pry for?I need to know what\\'s going on. GERALT: I just need to know what this is all about.MANFRED: Ah, it\\'s a long story.GERALT: I\\'ve got time.MANFRED: It started before the victory at Brenna. When we split Aedirn between ourselves and Nilfgaard, we were shamed throughout the North...GERALT: What\\'s that got to do with the coins?MANFRED: Everyone wanted to thrash the Black Ones, not play brother to them. A group of officers hatched a plot, the coins their mark... I don\\'t know who gathered the first group of plotters, but the seeds of the scheme fell on fertile soil and sprouted quickly.MANFRED: Then came Brenna and it all died down. The plotters themselves lost direction, though it seems they resurfaced recently.GERALT: Is Henselt dealing with Nilfgaard again?MANFRED: Who knows? But he\\'s welcomed that shriveled old bat here and spends time in discussions with him. That plot - well, the lads just want to prevent the Black Ones from meddling in our affairs. Naught more.GERALT: You know a lot. You got a coin?MANFRED: Argh, I\\'m old and know that he who gains power loses his heart. I\\'m past the age of takin\\' the crown off one head and placin\\' it on another. But my son still believes a monarch can be just. Why must you know if I\\'ve a coin?I can\\'t say. GERALT: I can\\'t say.SVEN: And neither can you, Father!MANFRED: An old soldier\\'s word is no handful of hay with which to wipe your arse.SVEN: I\\'ll have naught to do with this.MANFRED: Argh. Go to Madame Carole\\'s brothel and ask for Whistling Wendy. The madame will take you to her tent and leave you alone. Wendy will ask what you wish. Tell her you want her smile to open the gates of paradise. Are we even?GERALT: Yeah.MANFRED: And beware of Vinson Traut - he may be hiding with the conspirators. Dangerous man, that one.SVEN: Dethmold\\'s looking for him, and if he finds him we may all end up tasting the executioner\\'s axe... That scoundrel falls into the sorcerer\\'s hands, he\\'ll give us all up to save his own skin.GERALT: I\\'ll be careful.SVEN: Traut wears a magic suit of armor. He could prove a difficult foe, even for you...  5.05 - IN CERVISIA VERITAS < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt can find three visibly drunk soldiers around the camp calling out for a man named Odrin. The first soldier is close by the elven prisoner.]SOLDIER 1: What do you want? Norm\\'lly, I only talk to drunks.Looking for Odrin? GERALT: I heard you calling for Odrin.SOLDIER 1: Thass right. I\\'m lookin\\' for him, so I called out. Got a problem with that?GERALT: I used to know a man named Odrin.SOLDIER 1: Not the same guy.GERALT: How do you know?SOLDIER 1: Odrin\\'d never deal with your kind. A right and true man, that one. Drinkin\\' without him\\'s like ploughing without a... woman.Heard anything about square coins? GERALT: Seen any square coins around here?SOLDIER 1: Square coins and white mice are good signs you hadda nuff of the booze. I need to find me mate. Lemme be.Let me buy you a beer. We could chat... GERALT: Let me buy you a beer.SOLDIER 1: All right...! What d\\'you want to talk about?I\\'m looking for work. GERALT: I\\'m looking for work.SOLDIER 1: With me...?!GERALT: Maybe Henselt needs a witcher.SOLDIER 1: Henselt... needs a brain.GERALT: I heard his soldiers love him.SOLDIER 1: Back in the day... Yes... Henselt was like a brother. In war, he drank what we did, ate the same grub... and ploughed the same whores as us.GERALT: When did that change?SOLDIER 1: When he started believing he\\'s invincible.GERALT: He had to give up on Aedirn three years ago.SOLDIER 1: What of it?! They convinced him he hadn\\'t lost. Get it? It was all that -hic- witch\\'s fault... See...? And he believed \\'em. Had the witch -hic- killed till she was dead. Now he\\'s all important... La-de-dah...SOLDIER 1: He\\'s just not the same, Henselt. But you\\'ll find work, I wager. All kinds of monstros\\'ties prowl the ravines.Dethmold has summoned me. GERALT: Dethmold summoned me.SOLDIER 1: Oh, fuck...GERALT: What\\'re you afraid of?SOLDIER 1: Hard enough to get inside Dethmold\\'s quarters, but bloody impossible to leave.GERALT: I\\'m sober. I think I\\'ll be able to find the door.SOLDIER 1: You wouldn\\'t scoff if you\\'d seen the broken bones... the gouged-out eyes... or men so crazy they didn\\'t rec\\'nize their own mothers. It\\'s true, that! Dethmold tortures anyone who wrongs him, even in the slightest. They say the sorcerer made Henselt burn Sabrina at the stake. Dethmold\\'s so strong at Henselt\\'s side - it\\'s a bad thing... very bad.The Virgin of Aedirn. GERALT: What do you know about the Virgin of Aedirn?SOLDIER 1: No one\\'s ploughed her!GERALT: I\\'m serious.SOLDIER 1: They say she\\'d killed a dragon... those Aedirnians have gone silly about her.GERALT: I heard the story about the dragon is true.SOLDIER 1: What of it? That don\\'t mean she should be crowned queen!GERALT: True. But people follow her.SOLDIER 1: Folk are fools and like freaky things.GERALT: Saskia\\'s a freak?SOLDIER 1: Maidenhood intact and hunting dragons! Ever heard of a stranger lass?[EXIT] See you. GERALT: In that case, see you around.[The second soldier is hanging around the soldiers\\' tents.]SOLDIER 2: What d\\'you want?Looking for Odrin? GERALT: I heard you calling out for Odrin.SOLDIER 2: What of it?GERALT: Just curious. Half the camp\\'s looking for him.SOLDIER 2: Well he\\'s gone and got lost. But Odrin\\'s a good man - he can drink six noggins of liquor, one after the other.GERALT: Wouldn\\'t mind buying him a pint. What does he look like?SOLDIER 2: Ordinary, like any soldier. \\'Cept he staggers a lot.Know anything about square coins? GERALT: I collect old coins.SOLDIER 2: Here in the camp? Are you daft?GERALT: I heard there are some overseas coins floating around. Square, with a fish on them or something.SOLDIER 2: Don\\'t know nothing \\'bout that. Fuck off.Tell me... GERALT: To talk. I just arrived.SOLDIER 2: What do you want to know?Is this place worth a longer stay? GERALT: This place worth staying around?SOLDIER 2: The company\\'s all right. All lads with balls, as far as I know.GERALT: I\\'ve noticed that. And the rest?SOLDIER 2: What rest?GERALT: Nobles? Dethmold? The King?SOLDIER 2: Can\\'t complain. The lord\\'s aren\\'t too lofty... Dethmold keeps the peace, great mage that he is. And our King\\'s the best. Long live King Henselt!GERALT: Yeah, long live.Think you\\'ll win? GERALT: Think you can beat Aedirn?SOLDIER 2: Can we ever!GERALT: It won\\'t be easy. They say Saskia\\'s gathered quite a force around Vergen.SOLDIER 2: What force? A band of short asses, peasant rabble and a few elves? Don\\'t forget, they\\'ll be dealin\\' with a legurl-- re-gu-- with a legular army.GERALT: So what\\'re you waiting for? Why aren\\'t you at Vergen\\'s gates?SOLDIER 2: The ploughing fog\\'s cut us off from Aedirn. Just yesterday, a company tried to get to the other side... Only three men returned.There\\'s no sorceress in Henselt\\'s entourage... GERALT: Henselt has no sorceress at court.SOLDIER 2: Indeed! And he won\\'t.GERALT: How do you know?SOLDIER 2: Wasn\\'t for naught he burned that Sabrina Gless... whatever. Won\\'t take on another after her. Dethmold would never agree to it, anyway.GERALT: Strange custom. Dethmold has more to say than the King?SOLDIER 2: How should I know? Sabrina\\'s dead and that\\'s that. Some mourn her, most just couldn\\'t give a goat\\'s arse.[EXIT] See you. GERALT: Oh, piss off.[The third soldier is just inside the gates of the camp.]SOLDIER 3: What is it, witcher?Who\\'s Odrin? GERALT: Who\\'s this Odrin you\\'re calling out for? A Kaedweni god of some sort?SOLDIER 3: Ha ha, Odrin a god? If you suggested the god of drinkin\\', I might agree. He\\'s a mate. We agreed to meet at the tavern, but he\\'s gone and got lost. If you find him, tell him we\\'re waiting.GERALT: How will I know it\\'s him?SOLDIER 3: Oh, you\\'ll know Odrin. Nobody quite like that cunt.Come across any square coins in the camp? GERALT: Can I speak freely?SOLDIER 3: If you want to be sly, best you step away.GERALT: I\\'m looking for someone with a square coin.SOLDIER 3: Why\\'s that?GERALT: I can only tell someone who has one.SOLDIER 3: You got one?GERALT: No.SOLDIER 3: Then don\\'t ask, for you\\'ll learn nothing.Answer a few questions for me? GERALT: I like to get my bearings once in a while.SOLDIER 3: We all do.GERALT: Will you answer some questions for me?SOLDIER 3: If I know how to... And if I can.Where are you from? GERALT: You from Kaedwen?SOLDIER 3: Like me father and grandfather before me.GERALT: Know what they say about you in Aedirn?SOLDIER 3: Folk always got somethin\\' to say about their neighbors.GERALT: Henselt wants to conquer Aedirn. What would you expect them to say?SOLDIER 3: They\\'re kingless in Aedirn now. They could use a good ruler.GERALT: They\\'ve got someone to rule. You don\\'t need to meddle.SOLDIER 3: Don\\'t be naive, the world\\'s no sandbox. Though come to think of it, the stronger bairns reign in the sandbox as well.I heard someone\\'s hatched a plot against Henselt. GERALT: I heard not everyone likes Henselt.SOLDIER 3: To be liked by everyone, you need not to have a mind of your own. And Henselt\\'s got one.GERALT: Put it this way, more and more people don\\'t like how he thinks.SOLDIER 3: We agreed to speak freely.GERALT: I\\'ve learned of a plot.SOLDIER 3: I promised I\\'d answer every question I know how and every question I can. That\\'s a question I cannot answer.What\\'s Síle doing here? GERALT: The sorceress named Síle...SOLDIER 3: She\\'s just arrived.GERALT: What for?SOLDIER 3: I\\'ve no clue. Do you ever know with witches? I mean, they never do what they say they\\'re doin\\'.GERALT: Could she become Henselt\\'s sorceress?SOLDIER 3: Our King\\'s already got an advisor for magic. And Dethmold don\\'t like competition... he likes sorceresses even less.[EXIT] See you. GERALT: Just touring the camp.[Geralt finds Odrin passed out near the water outside the western gate of the camp, surrounded by empty bottles.]GERALT: Get up, you piss pump. Your friends are worried sick about you.ODRIN: Wha...? Where am I? Wha\\' am I doin\\' here? This is strange...Odrin? GERALT: Are you Odrin?ODRIN: Odrin, thass right! And tha\\' one was a cunt-runt, not a proper whore, y\\'know...? I was all la-de-dah, I\\'ll plough you nice, I says... And she done scream at me... like a bruxa!GERALT: Listen, Odrin, you\\'re so drunk a single spark and you\\'d be a torch. Now, straighten up and shut up, or the guards won\\'t let you in the camp.ODRIN: So I says to her, I says, \"Square, shmare.... What square? What the fuck fish do you mean? I wanna plough...\" and this cunt\\'s prattlin\\' on about square fish...GERALT: Tell me about the square fish later. We gotta get you back to your friends. They\\'re worried about you.ODRIN: Me mates? Uuulf? Uuulf, me brother, where is he? ULF, ULF!GERALT: Calm down. And try not to puke on the guards.GERALT: Calm down and stand up straight.ODRIN: Down, up... Yesssiiir!ODRIN: I\\'m goin\\' where I\\'m goin\\'...ODRIN: And I\\'m not goin\\' where I\\'m not... goin\\'.ODRIN: I\\'m goooooiiiinnn\\'![Geralt carries Odrin back up to the gates.]GUARD: Halt! What\\'s that corpse you want to drag into the camp?GERALT: Private Odrin. He\\'s, uh, uh, sick...GUARD: Looks like he slept in a vat full of booze. And smells like he fell out a dwarf\\'s arsehole.ODRIN: Why, you limp-arse prick! You sayin\\' I stink?! C\\'mere!GERALT: Odrin, shut up.He\\'s my prisoner. I need to question him. GERALT: This soldier didn\\'t drink of his own accord.GUARD: Oh, yeah...? Looks just like a teetotaler.GERALT: I had to question him.GUARD: And get him blind drunk in the process?GERALT: I have my methods. You know something that unties the tongue better than liquor?GUARD: Hmm... All right, come in. But hide him somewhere till he sobers up. You don\\'t want no officer catching sight of him.He\\'s an important witness. He has to get in. GERALT: King Henselt\\'s in danger and this is the only man who can provide important information.ODRIN: Thass riiiight... I\\'m the fuckin\\' only man... The only one, get it? Hic! Thasss me!!!GERALT: Shut up, Odrin.GUARD: Important information? From him?GERALT: You better believe it.GUARD: The commander catches him in the camp in that state, he\\'ll skin him alive. Then skin me alive for lettin\\' him in.Report it wherever you need to. GERALT: Not my concern. If you want, report it to your commander. I\\'m going to question this drunk then hand him over to the guards.GUARD: All right, but I warned you. Come in.How much to get him in? GERALT: Tough life, being a guard.GUARD: Aye...GERALT: And the pay\\'s piss poor...GUARD: Don\\'t I know it. Thirty gold coins and you\\'re in.GERALT: Come on, Odrin.ODRIN: With you?! Never!GERALT: Calm down and let\\'s go.ODRIN: After you talked all that shite about me? You stinkin\\' prick! I\\'ll not go anywhere wi\\' you, not on my life.[BRIBE] Thankless job, standing guard like that...  [FAILURE] GUARD: The gentleman witcher jests. [SUCCESS] GERALT: All right... Odrin... Come on...ODRIN: Where do all these drunks come from....? Sheesh, fuck... and the mice...?ODRIN: I\\'M BAAAACK! I WOOOOON! YEA HAHOOOO!ODRIN: I know you missed me! Well, I\\'m back!GERALT: Shut up, Odrin. Let\\'s look for your friends.ODRIN: Uh-huh! See, I\\'m goin\\' to take me a nap right here... You wake me jusassoon as you\\'ve brought \\'em to me...GERALT: Odrin, stop fucking around and get up!ODRIN: What, hm? Who are yooouuu...? Ah, right... Wait a second...ODRIN: Hm... D\\'you see that? Sumthin\\' jus\\' flew past me head...[Geralt picks Odrin up and walks him around the camp to pick up the three other drunk soldiers, then leads all four of them to the canteen.]ODRIN: Beeeeeeeer!GERALT: I\\'m buying.SOLDIER 1: Ever see a witcher spreading coin around? Well? Ever?SOLDIER 2: A first for me.GERALT: It all depends on the company.ODRIN: Hear that, cocksuckers?! Now step the fuck \\'way from me bessst maaate...GERALT: Beer inspires great conversation.ODRIN: Now that was... beautiful... what you said...SOLDIER 3: So -hic- what are we gonna converse about?Everyone\\'s afraid of Henselt... GERALT: I came here from Temeria.ODRIN: I visited once. Beautiful country... The women there have huuuuuuge tits...GERALT: People in Temeria fear Henselt. They think he\\'ll take advantage of Foltest\\'s death and attack from the west.SOLDIER 2: They\\'re right, heh-heh-heh. And while he\\'s at it, Henselt\\'ll plough all his other neighbors, too.GERALT: I hear people fear him more each day.SOLDIER 3: Folk fear kings, just as ants fear bears, wouldn\\'t you say?The ants oughta hire a hunter. GERALT: If they had any brains, the ants would hire a hunter.ODRIN: Thass right! Here\\'s to the hunter!SOLDIER 3: What\\'re you driving at?GERALT: Just interested in knowing what you think of your king.What if the ants all got together? GERALT: Ants are small and stupid. They don\\'t realize that if all the anthills united, they\\'d easily kick the bear\\'s ass.ODRIN: Thasss right! Long live the ants!SOLDIER 3: Who are you?I want to help you. GERALT: Let\\'s say I\\'m someone who can help you.SOLDIER 1: With what?! Huh?!GERALT: Your plot against Henselt.SOLDIER 2: Shut up, or you\\'ll send us all to the gallows!SOLDIER 3: We\\'ll not drink with you. Step away.[The conversation ends.]I need some information. GERALT: I like to know who I\\'m drinking with.ODRIN: With frieeendzzz...SOLDIER 3: Your presence here is no coincidence, I sense.GERALT: I don\\'t particularly like Henselt and I\\'m just interested to know what you think of him.SOLDIER 1: There was a time I\\'d\\'ve put me head on the block for him.GERALT: Was?SOLDIER 1: Wouldn\\'t be around if it weren\\'t for Henselt. It\\'s true! He saved me old man in battle. Pop just lost an eye and his right hand.SOLDIER 2: But not his bollocks!SOLDIER 1: He\\'d not do that now.Think Henselt might have a job for me? GERALT: I\\'m looking for work. Think Henselt could use a witcher?SOLDIER 3: Dethmold would make better use of one.SOLDIER 1: Aye, he\\'ll cut you up into bits an\\' look at them \\'neath a scope. Like a frooooog.SOLDIER 2: Shut it! Dethmold\\'s got long arms and even sharper ears.Something\\'s awry. GERALT: I\\'m not sure it\\'s good that a mage has so much power.SOLDIER 3: That\\'s the King\\'s concern, not ours.GERALT: It\\'s your concern if you\\'re afraid of Dethmold.ODRIN: Dethmold\\'s a pri-i-i-i-i-ick!SOLDIER 2: Shut up, Odrin, before I lash you!GERALT: Beer all round!SOLDIER 2: No. We\\'ll not drink with you. You\\'re a spy!ODRIN: Geralt, a spy?! Draw your sword! Hic!SOLDIER 3: Calm yourselves. And you, step away, \\'fore anything dramatic happens.[The conversation ends.]Henselt knows what he\\'s doing. GERALT: Henselt trusts Dethmold. I think the King knows what he\\'s doing.SOLDIER 1: He don\\'t know shite. I stand by it - Dethmold\\'s got him under his thumb.SOLDIER 2: Quiet down...GERALT: Folk are happy, though. That\\'s what\\'s important.SOLDIER 1: Folk have had Henselt about up to the tops of their -hic- helmets! Things go on like this -hic- they\\'ll knock his fat arse off that throne.SOLDIER 1: He don\\'t look to his soldiers no more. Forgotten us, the ingrate.ODRIN: Well, it\\'s no s\\'prise they wanna get rid of \\'im, eh?SOLDIER 2: Odrin, shut it.ODRIN: Geralt\\'s like a brother! I\\'ll keep nooooo secrets from him...GERALT: Who\\'re you talking about?ODRIN: A knave, greedy and cruel. Kills for pleasure... The son of a bitch has magic armor and plays tough. Thought he could do what he pleased until he caught Dethmold\\'s eye. Now he\\'s hiding...ODRIN: Too bad about them other lads. If Traut\\'s caught, he\\'ll give them all up. Heads\\'ll roll, I tell ye. Some peoples\\'ve come together to plot. They wanted me to join them, but I wass toooo busy. And I don\\'t trust this Traut. Them other coiners is all right, but Vinson\\'s a greedy sadist.GERALT: Where can I find them?ODRIN: Whatcha mean, where? The brothel, \\'course. Ask for Whistling Wendy.GERALT: I\\'m not looking for a whore...ODRIN: Once you have her - pay attention now - tell her you want her smile to open the gates of paradise. Get it right! \\'Cept you won\\'t get to fuck her, then. Ah! And give her this... I\\'ve no use for this coin, won\\'t buy me no beer... Wendy\\'ll take you to them coiners.  5.06 - CONSPIRACY THEORY: PLOTTERS\\' DEN < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Before going to Wendy and finding the leader of the coiners, Geralt can optionally talk to Dethmold about what he found.]Vinson Traut - name ring a bell? GERALT: Does the name Vinson Traut sound familiar?DETHMOLD: A traitor. He did some damage in my ranks – one dead and two still in the field hospital. If you know where he\\'s hiding, I\\'ve some issues I\\'d like to discuss with him. The tools are already in the fire, but the rogue seems to have donned an invisibility cap.GERALT: I believe he has Seltkirk\\'s armor – one of the artifacts.DETHMOLD: My investigation\\'s at a dead end. I know not where he is and I\\'ll soon need to resort to more radical methods.GERALT: Hold off a bit longer. If he escapes...DETHMOLD: There\\'s no way to do so. My people guard the ford, and I doubt our brave Vinson could make it past the specters. He must be nearby.I found the plotters\\' den. GERALT: The plotters – I know where they meet.DETHMOLD: I knew I could count on you.GERALT: Is that enough for you, then?DETHMOLD: One can tell a real man not by how he begins, but by how he finishes.GERALT: What else do you want from me?DETHMOLD: I shall give you four of my men, who\\'ll be near at hand and provide backup if something goes awry. They\\'ll stay out of sight until summoned. Bring me one of the plotters alive. I have many questions. I must know who\\'s behind all this.[Geralt can also ask Roche for assistance with the plotters.]ROCHE: Here to spy on us?GERALT: Who would I be spying for?ROCHE: For Henselt. For Dethmold. I heard they hired you.GERALT: It just so happens we have common aims. But don\\'t worry, observing Vernon Roche isn\\'t one of them.ROCHE: In that case, to what do I owe this pleasure?I\\'m looking for the plotters who are out to get Henselt. GERALT: How are things, Vernon?ROCHE: Quiet. Nothing to talk about, really. Like everybody else, I\\'m waiting to see how events unfold.GERALT: Why not stop waiting and try setting something in motion?ROCHE: My people are combing the area for Letho, who seems to have vanished. There\\'s nothing else I can do. What are you up to?GERALT: Busy as ever. I need to lift the fog of specters, reverse Sabrina\\'s curse and find out who\\'s behind the plot to assassinate Henselt.ROCHE: I never thought I\\'d see you so eager to help Henselt.GERALT: Coincidence. Our interests happen to have aligned.ROCHE: Hm... What interest might you have in tracking down this plot?GERALT: I get the feeling it\\'s all linked. If I can\\'t get to the bottom of this plot, I\\'ll be unable to lift the curse and never recover my past.ROCHE: In any case, I wonder who\\'s behind it.GERALT: Well, I know where the plotters meet. If you want to learn more, come with me.ROCHE: That would be a grave error. A captain of the Temerian army shouldn\\'t meddle in the domestic matters of another state.GERALT: I thought that\\'s exactly what they pay you to do.ROCHE: Sorry, Geralt. This time I truly cannot help.[Geralt goes to Madame Carole.]CAROLE: Well, well, a witcher. Girls, prim yourselves! How can I help you, handsome?I wouldn\\'t mind a romp with one of your girls. GERALT: I\\'m looking for a whore.CAROLE: We\\'ve got plenty of those, you\\'ll be glad to hear. But you\\'ll need to show me your coin before you choose one. We all have our principles.I\\'ve got coin - square money, to be exact.  [Geralt shows her the square coin.]CAROLE: Well, these are my girls. Choose, white-haired one.Whistling Wendy. GERALT: I\\'ve heard good things about Whistling Wendy.CAROLE: At your service. My prettiest girl, \\'tis true. Fool soldiers gave her that stupid nickname. Tidy yourself, Wendy! Witcher on the way! Come on in![Geralt enters the brothel tent, where Wendy is waiting for him.]WENDY: What do you desire, my hero?Just to talk. GERALT: Conversation.WENDY: Piss off! That\\'s like visiting town hall to plough the mayor up the arse. Town hall\\'s where you want to talk, here\\'s where you want to fuck.GERALT: I\\'ll pay.WENDY: What is it with you fighting men? No one comes to the brothel to plough anymore! Talk and talk, and me with my lisp. I mean, I\\'m shite at talking and great at other things! But, have it your way.How are things in the camp? GERALT: How\\'s the mood among the soldiers?WENDY: Shittin\\' themselves before the battle. And they\\'d rather get blind drunk than let us honest strumpets make a decent living. They were eager at first, but the longer there\\'s no action, the less lively the men are. Fighting and ploughing are a lot alike. Lust for one, lust for the other.Heard any rumors about the king? GERALT: Any rumors circulating about Henselt?WENDY: What can a simple whore know about the King?GERALT: Whores know everything about everyone.WENDY: Well, he fucked me a few times, but the conversation wasn\\'t terribly exciting. He hollered a bit – \"I\\'m a great ruler! Tell me so, you stupid whore!\" Or he had me hollerin\\': \"Fuck me harder, my hero!\" What\\'s it to me? I hollered.Have you heard of Saskia? GERALT: Have you heard of the Virgin of Aedirn, Saskia?WENDY: You\\'re right daft, you are! Talkin\\' to a whore about virgins?GERALT: I am.WENDY: Here\\'s what I think: a maturing woman\\'s never been with a man – well, not likely her head\\'s on straight. That lust for power\\'s straight from the cock on her mind.I\\'m looking for a kingslayer. GERALT: I\\'m looking for a kingslayer.WENDY: In a brothel?!GERALT: You think kingslayers don\\'t have sex?WENDY: Not here, they don\\'t.What do you think? GERALT: Show me what you can do.WENDY: You\\'re about to get the fuck of your life, darling.[Geralt and Wendy have sex.]This is stupid. GERALT: Oh, nothing.WENDY: Wha...? Who\\'d you take me for? A blazing priestess?GERALT: I\\'ll drop in another time.I want your smile to part the gates of paradise. GERALT: I want your smile to part the gates of paradise.WENDY: Come with me.[Wendy leads him into the back, where she opens a trapdoor into a tunnel. Geralt jumps down and goes through the door into a carved stone room lined with cells, where Vinson Traut and several other coiners are waiting.]GERALT: Vinson Traut. You\\'re a little elusive.VINSON: Here alone? Not wise, witcher...GERALT: We\\'ll see about that.VINSON: I\\'m wearing Seltkirk\\'s armor, you know. Pretty much renders me invincible in a duel.[If Geralt didn\\'t talk to Zyvik about Seltkirk\\'s armor] GERALT: I didn\\'t know you had Seltkirk\\'s armor. I guess that changes things...VINSON: If you think we\\'re willing to let you go... or that you can escape through magic trickery of some sort...GERALT: Relax. I\\'m not going anywhere.GERALT: Give me the chainmail and I\\'ll forget everything - Whistling Wendy, your plot... I know about the coins...VINSON: You\\'re Dethmold\\'s hound. I don\\'t trust you.GERALT: You don\\'t need to, I just need the chainmail. Not interested in anything else.VINSON: I\\'m to remove it?GERALT: And hand it over.VINSON: Then you\\'ll be on your way?GERALT: And all will be well.VINSON: Doesn\\'t sound like my kind of story. How\\'s this instead: I\\'ll kill you, take your swords and gold, and the gods will rain good fortune upon me for ridding them of a filthy mutant? Die![With or without the help of Dethmold\\'s men, Geralt kills Vinson and the other conspirators. Afterwards, he searches Vinson\\'s body to get Seltkirk\\'s armor, the key to the room, and an anti-Henselt leaflet.][If Geralt brought Dethmold\\'s men] GERALT: Search the bodies.GERALT: Hm... Nothing useful here, they must\\'ve been pawns. Report back to Dethmold.GERALT: In the meantime, I need to talk to a writer I know...[Geralt finds Dandelion and confronts him.]Is this your crap? GERALT: I found a letter addressed to the people of Kaedwen.DANDELION: A letter? Mm... So?GERALT: It\\'s your drivel, idiot!DANDELION: Where\\'d you get that idea?GERALT: I know you! Not to mention you had the gall to quote me.DANDELION: You\\'re not the only witcher in the world.GERALT: So, you admit it\\'s yours!DANDELION: Sure it\\'s mine! People have had enough of that pompous clown colluding with Nilfgaard. I decided I needed to open their eyes a little wider.GERALT: Any idea what that pompous clown\\'s going to do when he finds out who\\'s opening his people\\'s eyes?DANDELION: How would he find out? It could only come from you and I assume, at least I hope, you won\\'t rat me out.GERALT: They\\'re going to kill you.DANDELION: Nah.GERALT: Why did you poke your nose in this?DANDELION: Henselt approached me to write a few panegyrics about him. You know, singing his praises. Can you imagine that?! Me, writing a political pamphlet?! Who the hell does he think I am?!GERALT: But that\\'s exactly what this letter is.DANDELION: Possibly... But it\\'s for a good cause. Henselt\\'s a prick.[Geralt goes to see Dethmold.]I found the conspirators and Traut. GERALT: I found Traut and a few other enthusiasts of the square coins.DETHMOLD: Did you learn who leads them?GERALT: No.DETHMOLD: Any survivors?GERALT: No.DETHMOLD: Argh, you might at least have spared Traut. I\\'m sure he had secrets.Lost your chance to learn those. GERALT: I\\'m afraid he took those with him.DETHMOLD: There was a reward on the conspirators\\' heads. Do you wish to collect, or is it beneath your witcher\\'s dignity?Any reward on the conspirators\\' heads? GERALT: Any reward for the conspirators?DETHMOLD: Indeed. A nice round sum per head...One can never have too much coin... GERALT: I could use the gold.DETHMOLD: How many were there?GERALT: Vinson and five others.DETHMOLD: You killed six men?! You and your kind should be isolated...GERALT: The reward...DETHMOLD: Is yours. Here.I don\\'t want coin. GERALT: I don\\'t want any gold for this.DETHMOLD: Why not?GERALT: You wouldn\\'t understand.  5.07 - LOST LAMBS AT SABRINA\\'S PYRE < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt leaves the camp to go investigate Sabrina\\'s pyre. As he exits, Zyvik stops him.]ZYVIK: Oi, witcher. Out in these wastelands hunting monsters? Well, if you see two of my men, tell them I\\'ll rip them both brand new arseholes if they miss muster.Tell them yourself. GERALT: Why don\\'t you look for them yourself?ZYVIK: I\\'ve not gone daft yet. Droves of monsters prowl near this gully, and life\\'s not grown tedious enough for me to just give it up.Maybe they\\'re dead. GERALT: They may never return.ZYVIK: Anything\\'s possible, but I for one hope they just overdid it with the liquor and fell asleep in some bush.Why did they go out there? GERALT: What are they doing there?ZYVIK: It\\'s a common malady. A day don\\'t go by that some dimwit don\\'t sneak out of the camp to go to the gullies.I\\'ll tell them if I run into them. GERALT: We\\'ll see if I come across anyone.ZYVIK: Luck be with you. You\\'re a good fellow. Ah - find them and you\\'ll see Corporal Zyvik knows how to be grateful.[Geralt finds Sabrina Glevissig\\'s pyre near the water south of the camp, as well as two soldiers huddling inside a circle of candles.]SOLDIER 1: Oy! What you doing here?I need to inspect the place. GERALT: Get out of the way, I need to inspect this area.SOLDIER 1: Be careful. They say stepping on the ashes brings bad luck.They\\'re looking for you. GERALT: I heard Zyvik can\\'t wait for you to get back.SOLDIER 2: Plough it all! If we miss muster he\\'ll have us flogged.SOLDIER 2: Get us out of here, will ye?GERALT: You came here on your own, you can get back on your own.SOLDIER 1: This place is crawling with drowners. I mean, we\\'d have stayed in our tents, on our arses, if we\\'d known. We\\'re safe in the Circle, but three feet outside and who knows what would happen...I\\'ll help you. GERALT: All right, we\\'ll go back together, but let me look around first.You\\'ll manage. GERALT: You\\'re soldiers, show some courage.SOLDIER 2: Have a heart.GERALT: I\\'ll think about it.[Geralt examines the pyre.]GERALT: Apparently, it\\'s bad luck to tread on the ashes...GERALT: The execution spot...GERALT: Who cares enough to bring all these things here?GERALT: A goat\\'s skull... A pixie ring... Black candles... A charred tree... Petrified bread... A raven\\'s corpse... Sour milk....GERALT: Strange aura... Let\\'s take a closer look.[Examine the pedestal.] GERALT: Carved from a solid piece of stone. Reusable, you could say...[Examine the items around the Circle.] GERALT: Candles, amulets, coins - people make offerings here, like they would at a shrine.[Examine the candles.] GERALT: Candles... The stench is worse than Zoltan\\'s boots... Nothing unusual about them otherwise.[Take the square coin.] GERALT: Square coins adorned with a fish... I guess the plotters like to come here.[Take the letter.] GERALT: Let\\'s see...[Listen.] GERALT: An unnatural stillness typical of Intersections and places where streams of the Power meet... Unnerving, but harmless.[Examine the human tracks.] GERALT: People seem to be staying away from the wheel - they\\'re afraid. All the \"gifts\" are at a safe distance from it... Except for one person... with Kaedweni army issue boots. Glad to know I\\'m not the only one to desecrate this site.[Examine the animal tracks.] GERALT: Animal tracks - dogs, wolves, bears, even birds... You\\'d think this was a feeding ground. But they all fear the Circle.GERALT: Except for cats. Their tracks are everywhere. One even napped on the pedestal. Triss once told me cats like to sleep on Intersections, and they\\'re the only beasts apart from dragons who can draw the Power. They clearly like this place.[Examine the wheel.] GERALT: Sabrina was nailed to this wheel.[Degree of charring.] GERALT: Something protected the wheel from the flames. It’s hardly scorched.[Fresh marks.] GERALT: Hm... Fresh holes and splinters. Someone\\'s pulled nails from the wheel recently.GERALT: I better take one, just in case...[Step away from the Circle.] GERALT: I need to bring the king here, I need to reenact the execution. If I can only summon Sabrina\\'s ghost, I could force her to lift the curse. The draugirs and the mist will remain, but at least the king\\'ll be safe.GERALT: I need to know what happened here. Witnesses of the execution, they\\'re the key. If I can just find out how Sabrina died, I should be able to free Henselt of the curse.GERALT: Two leads - Sabrina\\'s cultists and the nail thief, who\\'s obviously immune to the aura of this place. Time to question some soldiers.[Geralt goes to the soldiers huddling inside the circle.]SOLDIER: You\\'ve looked and touched your fill, right? Let\\'s get outta here!Did you light those candles? GERALT: Did you light those candles?SOLDIER 1: We did.SOLDIER 2: What\\'s it to you?This is dangerous ground. GERALT: From what I\\'ve seen, it\\'s not safe here.SOLDIER 1: The beasts are too scared to come near the Circle.GERALT: Maybe, but you gotta leave the Circle to return to camp.SOLDIER 2: Help us get back.GERALT: If you all know this area is infested with monsters, why the hell did you come here?SOLDIER 1: On a kind of pilgrimage, to visit the Circle.Is that some kind of altar? GERALT: Burning them for Sabrina?SOLDIER 1: To you, \\'tis a waste of time, right?SOLDIER 2: Feel their eyes on ya? They\\'re watching us. We won\\'t get out alive, superstitious idiots that we are.SOLDIER 1: Don\\'t you believe the Visionary? You don\\'t have to... but it was worth a try, right?SOLDIER 2: Old idiot! It\\'s his fault we ended up here.Who\\'s the Visionary? GERALT: Who is this Visionary?SOLDIER 2: He\\'s behind all this. He talks of miracles in the Circle.What did he tell you? GERALT: What kind of stories did the Visionary tell?SOLDIER 1: He says, if we burn candles, the dead sorceress\\' spirit will save us from death in battle.SOLDIER 2: He also says only those who believe will survive.SOLDIER 1: I believe him. Know why? He lives deep in the valleys, but something protects him from all those harpies.[If Geralt has met the Visionary] GERALT: I know who you\\'re talking about.Did you see the execution? GERALT: Did you see them burn the sorceress?SOLDIER 1: Three years ago? We both served under Henselt then, but only the 5th Company guarded the stake.SOLDIER 2: They say the king never wanted to make a spectacle. Some soldiers never come here, but others visit the Circle to check the remains.SOLDIER 1: You\\'re just like them. To you, it\\'s only a superstition to make money from. You\\'re looking for old nails in the ashes.SOLDIER 2: Like that shitbag who trades outside the inn.GERALT: You\\'re mistaking me for someone else.[If Geralt took a nail from the shrine] SOLDIER 1: Really? Then give us the nail.I\\'m keeping it. GERALT: I\\'m keeping it.SOLDIER 1: Keeping it? Not heard what they say? Relics are like fisstech for simple folk!Take it. GERALT: Here, take it.SOLDIER 1: Really? Ta.How did you get here? GERALT: How did you manage to avoid the drowners on your way here?SOLDIER 2: The Visionary was with us, he led us through, then left.Let\\'s go. GERALT: I don\\'t like this place.[If Geralt earlier agreed to go back with them] SOLDIER 2: Thought you\\'d want to stay the night here.GERALT: I know at least a few places I\\'d rather sleep. Come on.[If Geralt told them to make it on their own] SOLDIER 1: We\\'re coming with you! We won\\'t make it back to the camp alone.SOLDIER 1: We just wanted to light some candles in the Circle... Didn\\'t know there\\'d be so many drowners.Let\\'s go then. GERALT: All right, follow me.I\\'m going alone, you can see if those candles are worth anything. GERALT: Go on your own. Sabrina\\'s powers will protect you from evil.SOLDIER 2: What a swine.[If Geralt leaves them behind] SOLDIER 1: I dunno. Maybe he\\'s right.SOLDIER 2: Who?SOLDIER 1: The witcher. That we have nothing to fear. As long as we burn candles, the sorceress will protect us.SOLDIER 2: But what if she don\\'t? Want to see if the monsters get you? I\\'ll wait here, thanks.SOLDIER 1: No way I\\'m goin\\' alone.SOLDIER 2: Then keep your trap shut.[If Geralt brings them with] SOLDIER 2: Beats me why they\\'ve been fighting over these hellholes for generations.SOLDIER 1: I get goose bumps every time I go outside the palisade.SOLDIER 2: Guess Zyvik was right, we should\\'ve sat on our arses.SOLDIER 1: You\\'ll be whistling a different tune when the mist lifts and we attack Vergen.SOLDIER 2: The Visionary\\'s a right bastard, leaving us here.SOLDIER 1: I believe him. He says he hears voices.SOLDIER 2: My nan heard voices, too. Her mouth would froth up like a dog\\'s and she\\'d shit all over. When my old man couldn\\'t take it anymore, he axed the hag to death.SOLDIER 1: Shut your gob.[Geralt escorts them through the drowner nest, defending them from drowners.][If both survive]SOLDIER 1: Curses on \\'em! If it wasn\\'t for you, they\\'d have eaten us.SOLDIER 2: We owe you our lives, witcher.SOLDIER 2: We can\\'t let Zyvik catch us.SOLDIER 1: Don\\'t shit your pants. Sabrina saved us from the monsters, so what\\'s one little Zyvik to her?[If only the first soldier lived] SOLDIER 1: He talked and talked until Sabrina turned her back on him.SOLDIER 1: Cheers, witcher. I owe you one.[If only the second soldier lived] SOLDIER 2: Sabrina\\'s a load of tripe. The lad burned candles, collected relics and still got torn to bits by the monsters.SOLDIER 2: Thanks, witcher. I owe you my life.[Geralt can talk to Zyvik afterwards.]I found those soldiers you were looking for. [If Geralt didn\\'t bring them back] ZYVIK: So... where are they?GERALT: I tried to get them back, couldn\\'t protect them from the monsters.ZYVIK: Dammit, witcher! We\\'re losing good fighting men on account of some ploughing superstition. What am I to put in my report? \"Evening stroll ends in death\"? Dammit all...[If only one survived] GERALT: I managed to save just one of your missing men.ZYVIK: I know. Got a full report. Says some monsters gave you hell on the way back. Well... One in the camp, one in the dirt - split the reward down the middle, I guess. You get half.[If both survived] GERALT: The soldiers you were looking for, they got held up for a while at Sabrina\\'s Circle.ZYVIK: Oh, the idiots! To be duped by witchcraft and superstitions! I\\'ll put them to scrubbing the latrines indefinitely.ZYVIK: But, I thank you for bringing \\'em back... Your reward - as promised.Know the relic peddler? GERALT: There\\'s a soldier by the inn selling scraps from Sabrina\\'s execution site.ZYVIK: I know. The damn quartermaster! This business of his muddles the minds of the soldiers. Suddenly, everyone believes a splinter in your pocket\\'ll protect you in battle. Halfwits.You\\'re right, it\\'s dumb. GERALT: They\\'ll pay for their folly with their lives.ZYVIK: And who the fuck are you to judge them? You roam around the world with no care for folk like us. Sure, you can fight. But you don\\'t have to get up, eat or fucking die when ordered. All my friends died on someone\\'s orders! You\\'ll never get it.True. GERALT: You\\'re right, I\\'ll never understand. Sorry.ZYVIK: What else do you want?You know nothing about me. GERALT: Go to hell, Zyvik. You don\\'t know a thing about me.ZYVIK: And I don\\'t want to. Go on your way.Maybe it works? GERALT: If the relics give them courage, so be it.ZYVIK: So far, all those candles have only brought us some tent fires.[Continues same as from \"ZYVIK: I\\'ll tell you one thing, witcher.\"]They\\'re just scared. GERALT: After what happened here three years ago, it\\'s no surprise they\\'re terrified.ZYVIK: I\\'ll tell you one thing, witcher. In combat I can count on my shield, my armor and my comrades, if they still live. Many of those boys will die in Vergen, even with their pockets stuffed with mystical splinters that cost a silver piece each.ZYVIK: I want them to be afraid. When steel hits steel, I want them to be alert, dammit. If they\\'re dumb and put their trust in rusty nails and ashes, they won\\'t have a hope in hell.Heard of the Visionary? GERALT: I heard there\\'s a man living outside the camp known as The Visionary. Ever met him?ZYVIK: The soldiers talk about him but I\\'ve never seen him. If I ever do, he\\'ll regret that he fooled my people with all those superstitions.Were you at Sabrina\\'s execution? GERALT: Did you see Sabrina\\'s execution?ZYVIK: Wish I could\\'ve, but only the 5th Company was sent there. She deserved it.ZYVIK: What she did to the boys... Believe me, I\\'ve seen a lot of monstrosities in my life. My brother died during a coup in Rinde, when a mage boiled the blood in his veins. Also, I once saw a soldier raping a dead elf woman.ZYVIK: But three years ago? People melted like lead - something you can\\'t forget, witcher.[Geralt can also check in on the relic seller. Nearby the tent, he overhears some soldiers arguing about nails.]SOLDIER 1: The peddler said this nail was the closest to her right hand!SOLDIER 2: You fool! You\\'d believe him if he told you it was Sabrina\\'s shin bone! He ripped you off!SOLDIER 1: We\\'ll see in the next battle. The relic will protect me. All you\\'ll have is the tin pan on that empty head of yours!GERALT: What\\'s going on?SOLDIER 3: Stay out of it.SOLDIER 1: Sabrina was a saint in her lifetime. Remember how she healed the wounded?!SOLDIER 2: But now she\\'s dead and can\\'t help anyone.SOLDIER 1: I believe the Visionary. Those who dismiss his words are doomed.SOLDIER 2: Doomed are those who take lunacy for prophecy and carcasses for holy arses.Don\\'t let me bother you. GERALT: I\\'ll leave you to it.What happened? GERALT: What\\'s this argument about?SOLDIER 1: I bought a relic to protect me from Scoia\\'tael arrows. They say I was ripped off.SOLDIER 2: That relic\\'s rubbish!Lemme see it. GERALT: Show me the relic.SOLDIER 1: What for?[If Geralt doesn\\'t have a nail from Sabrina\\'s wheel] GERALT: I just wanna look at it.SOLDIER 1: And?GERALT: A nail like any other.SOLDIER 1: It\\'s not any old nail. Sabrina was nailed to the wheel with this! It\\'ll protect me in battle.GERALT: If you believe that, all\\'s well.[If Geralt has the nail] GERALT: I have a similar nail. Mine\\'s rusty, but this one looks like new.SOLDIER 1: So what?!SOLDIER 3: Told ya! The seller ripped you off.GERALT: I\\'d like to talk to him.SOLDIER 1: Better hurry up, \\'cos if he conned me I\\'ll chop his head off.GERALT: So long.[Inside the canteen tent, Geralt approaches the relic seller.]RELIC SELLER: Relics, artifacts, trinkets and talismans – hallowed and highly valuable!I found recent footprints in the ashes. GERALT: I found footprints at Sabrina\\'s execution site, do you know anything about that?RELIC SELLER: Why would I? You found them, not me.GERALT: Yet your boots are black from ash.RELIC SELLER: Sssssh! All right, what d\\'you want to know?You believe the items you sell have power? GERALT: Do you believe in the power of your merchandise?RELIC SELLER: You mean the relics? Others believe in them, that\\'s what counts. They\\'ll believe in anything that\\'ll give them hope. Soldiers shit their pants and throw up in fear before going into battle.RELIC SELLER: If kissing a rusty nail gives them courage, then in my book it works.Did you see the execution? GERALT: Did you see Sabrina\\'s execution?RELIC SELLER: Sure I did, I was in the 5th Company. I remember the commotion when that idiot Yahon killed her with a spear. Ah, if only I had that spear now.Do you remember Sabrina\\'s curse? GERALT: Do you remember the curse that Sabrina placed on the King?RELIC SELLER: When they set the stake on fire, she shouted something to the King. His face went red, but I couldn\\'t hear very well.RELIC SELLER: She probably foretold his syphilis, a gruesome death.Where do you get the relics? GERALT: Where did you get these things?RELIC SELLER: Trying to compete with me? It\\'s too good a business to share with others.Where is Yahon\\'s spear? GERALT: Where is Yahon\\'s spear now?RELIC SELLER: I don\\'t know. Besides which it\\'s none of your concern. I simply won\\'t talk about that.Do you know Yahon well? GERALT: You know Yahon?RELIC SELLER: Never heard of him. Where\\'d you get the idea that I know him?Tell me more about Sabrina. GERALT: Do you remember the sorceress, Sabrina?RELIC SELLER: Same as all the others. Looked like a young nympho, but an old hag inside. You want to talk about her? See that freak who burns candles.  5.08 - THE CAPTURED ELF < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt approaches the imprisoned Scoia\\'tael.]GUARD: What do you want?Has he spilled anything yet? GERALT: Get anything important out of him?GUARD: Not really... We salted his wounds, broke his fingers, scorched his feet... But he didn\\'t so much as peep his own name. Tried to bite off his own tongue, in fact. Them elves like a bit of sufferin\\' methinks.GERALT: Maybe he\\'s hoping to be rescued.GUARD: Not likely. Someone massacred them - the whole unit. That\\'s what the royal mages asked him about - who it was and where they are now. There\\'s no understanding elves. If he answered, we\\'d hang him quickly, he\\'d have peace, but he prefers to suffer...How did you catch him? GERALT: How did you catch him?GUARD 1: We didn\\'t. Nothing to boast of, really. We found \\'im - barely alive.GUARD 2: He was lyin\\' in the ravines among the corpses of other Squirrels. Terrible bloodbath it was.GUARD 1: As if a mad medic slashed them with a giant scalpel! Aiming at their arteries, no less, for there was blood everywhere. Nasty splashes even high up on the rocks.GERALT: When was this?GUARD 1: Before that ghastly fog appeared.Can I talk to him? [If Geralt hasn\\'t helped out soldiers around camp] GUARD: No chance. I don\\'t know ya.GERALT: Hm. How might we get to know each other?GUARD: Trust needs to be earned, mate. You\\'d best go... now.[If Geralt rescued the soldiers by Sabrina\\'s pyre] GUARD: You\\'re all right. I heard you\\'ve been helping our lads... Talk away. But be quick. If the corporal sees you, he\\'ll have your balls... and ours...ELF: Bloede... vatt\\'ghern? What do you want?GERALT: Information.Who are you? GERALT: You from Iorveth\\'s unit?ELF: And proud of it. Iorveth will avenge me.GERALT: Maybe.You were caught because of me. GERALT: I\\'m responsible for you being captured.ELF: I don\\'t understand.GERALT: I warned Iorveth that the kingslayer had betrayed him. Your leader\\'s alive because of me.ELF: You lie! You\\'re not one of us...GERALT: Never claimed to be. I\\'m not interested in your fight. Nor in that of the humans. I have my own goals. I\\'m hunting the kingslayer and need information.

Leave me be.]  5.09 - VISITING THE VISIONARY < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt sets out to see the Visionary. On the way he encounters a set of Kaedweni soldiers fighting rotfiends.]SOLDIER: Heeeelp!SOLDIER: For Sabrina, who died on the pyre - help us![Geralt helps fight off the rotfiends.][If only one soldier survives] SOLDIER: Thanks for your help, witcher... If not for you, I\\'d\\'ve ended up like my mates, there.[If only one soldier dies] SOLDIER: Thanks for the help, witcher... If not for you. We\\'d end up like our mate, there.[If all survive] SOLDIER: Thanks for your help, witcher! We were in a tight spot, there. The rotfiends are multiplying like rabbits.SOLDIER: We were on our way to the see the Visionary, bearing gifts and all. But I\\'ll be damned if I\\'ll take one more step that way. Wouldn\\'t be on your way to see him, would you? If y\\'are, give him this coin for us. Ah, do what you will...[Geralt takes the coin for the Visionary. Further into the ravines, he comes across a hut encircled by candles, and is attacked by harpies.]VISIONARY: Over here! Inside the candles!VISIONARY: Quick! You\\'ll be safe here![Geralt enters the candle circle, and the monsters stop attacking.]VISIONARY: We\\'re safe here.VISIONARY: I awaited them. They were to come bearing gifts. I heard their cries, guess they were attacked. If they\\'re not here, they must be dead...They\\'re alive, but they won\\'t bring you any coin. GERALT: Rotfiends attacked them. But they managed to escape with their lives. Weren\\'t up for any more adventure, though, and went back to camp.VISIONARY: You listen... I know those soldiers, and I know they do all kinds of nasty things, but not one of them would dare cheat me.They\\'re alive. Here\\'s your coin. GERALT: No, they\\'re alive. They didn\\'t want to risk it anymore, went back to camp. They asked me to give you this coin - for candles?VISIONARY: This is but half. Why, I\\'ll not do more than braid some wicks for this.[If the soldiers died] Got that right. GERALT: Neither of them survived, unfortunately.VISIONARY: You\\'re a witcher, hunting monsters is your daily bread. You couldn\\'t help them? Is it \\'cause they were simple soldiers?VISIONARY: What do you want from me? I\\'ll not believe you came here by chance.GERALT: Yeah, you\\'re right. I need to learn some things, and few are willing to talk. Sabrina Glevissig\\'s story - that\\'s what interests me most.VISIONARY: Listen. I\\'ll not speak with you until I get my coin, pure and simple. Though I do provide charitable help to the faithful. If you were to become one of them...[BRIBE] Would you take a donation?  [Not enough coin] VISIONARY: Do you mock me? What\\'s the idea? This is piddling! [SUCCESS] VISIONARY: Wonderful. That\\'s about right. So tell me, what\\'s on your mind?Sure, I\\'ll join your faith. GERALT: I\\'ve heard a lot of good things about you. All right, I\\'ll become a follower.VISIONARY: Wonderful! Listen then, for I\\'ll not say this twice. If your intentions are pure, you will do as I ask. Each convert must pass a test. You will spend the night at the old chapel near Sabrina\\'s Pupils.GERALT: Where?VISIONARY: Twin lakes I have named in her honor.GERALT: Is that all?VISIONARY: Before you kneel to meditate, you will drink the mixture I shall give you. You must then remember all that occurs. That\\'s very important, as you\\'ll need to recount it to me fully.GERALT: All right. I\\'ll come back once I\\'m done.[Inside the Visionary\\'s cabin, Geralt can find two note fragments, revealing that the Visionary is Yahon, the soldier who pierced Sabrina\\'s heart. He goes to the twin lakes and after dusk, kneels before the alter there and drinks the potion. His vision blurs.]GERALT: I\\'m too old for this.[Geralt sees a vision of a forest of giant, phallic mushrooms, and a chicken the size of a tower. As he approaches the chicken, the vision ends. He wakes up on the ledge above the altar.]GERALT: Errrr... Don\\'t know that anybody needs to know about that one...[Geralt picks up a third note on the ledge describing Yahon\\'s conversion to the cult of Sabrina. Geralt returns to the Visionary.]VISIONARY: Huh...? What other matters?I spent the night by Sabrina\\'s Pupils... GERALT: I did what you asked.VISIONARY: Tell me what you saw.Sabrina. GERALT: Sabrina Glevissig appeared to me. She walked across the waters of a lake, her airy robes and long black hair caressing the waves.VISIONARY: You lie. I don\\'t know what you were hoping for, but we\\'ll not talk about Sabrina unless you actually meditate.The last Battle of Vergen. GERALT: I saw the Battle of Vergen. Henselt\\'s mercenaries swarmed the walls. The dead lay thick on the ground, but the Kaedwenis broke through the defenses and drove into the town.VISIONARY: You lie. I don\\'t know what you were hoping for, but we\\'ll not talk about Sabrina unless you actually meditate.A strange forest and a giant hen. GERALT: You may think I\\'m as mad as you are, but in my vision I walked through a forest where the trees were huge mushrooms and a giant chicken walked between them, pecking at the underbrush...VISIONARY: You have no idea how happy I am. I\\'ve been having this vision of a giant hen among mammoth mushrooms for weeks... I thought I\\'d lost it, gone insane. Turns out, my herbs must have gone off. I\\'ll need to gather new ones, but that\\'s my concern. Ask me what you will.GERALT: You must know a lot about Sabrina Glevissig\\'s death.VISIONARY: Ah, Sabrina the Martyr left the world of the living to protect us all.Heard about Sabrina\\'s curse? GERALT: Did you hear about the curse Sabrina cast on the King?VISIONARY: Of course. A well-deserved punishment - a ghostly spell from her crimson lips!VISIONARY: The King concocted a cruel fate for the sorceress, humiliated her, made her suffer the flames. Bound to a wheel and placed on the stake, she suffered in a way unimaginable to ordinary humans.VISIONARY: But when the flame reached her maiden waist, not a single cry could be heard, only words foretelling King Henselt\\'s imminent demise. Let a shooting star split the heavens and mark its mortal journey with a braid of blood! Let fools be duped by the sight of fish scales turned by magic into square pieces of gold! Let the Unicorn violate thousand year-old rules, prompting a just punishment!VISIONARY: Sabrina suffered so badly that a merciful soldier ended her torment, thrusting his spear into her aching heart.Why do you light candles for Sabrina? GERALT: Why the candles? What\\'s the difference between Sabrina and other mages burned at the stake?VISIONARY: Others were strong in life. Her power bloomed when death wrapped its steely arms around her. She took the soldier who ended her suffering under her kind care. He never had to fear walking alone in the dark again.VISIONARY: Have you seen the area? It\\'s full of beasts and monstrosities. Yahon, the merciful soldier, has walked in the blaze of her power ever since. No creature born of darkness can get close to him.Do you know what happened to the spear? GERALT: Any chance of finding that spear?VISIONARY: It was so long ago, witcher, but I believe the spear went to another soldier. The bugger sells relics from our Lady by the camp inn.[If Geralt has talked to the relic seller] GERALT: I know who you mean.I\\'ve got a few more questions. GERALT: Now, back to some other matters...Who are you? GERALT: Who are you?VISIONARY: Our descendants will decide who we were when they see what we\\'ve left behind.Where can I find Yahon? GERALT: Is Yahon still around?VISIONARY: Yahon is dead. He didn\\'t deserve to bask in the glory of the Lady.GERALT: So, Sabrina\\'s mercy has limits?VISIONARY: You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about, witcher.Know anything about the ghosts fighting on the battlefield? GERALT: The valley\\'s been engulfed by a battle of specters. Know anything about it?VISIONARY: It\\'s a place of horror. You can still hear the sound of steel and the cries of the dying. If you want to soothe their pain, you have to believe that Sabrina is watching over you benevolently.GERALT: I won\\'t achieve anything without some memory tokens - magically active conduits left by those who fell in battle. They\\'re supposed to symbolize faith, courage, hatred and death.VISIONARY: Faith? I don\\'t know what those soldiers believed, but their faith didn\\'t help them, they were deceived. Courage, hatred and death? There was too much of all of them... Especially death. But I remember a knight who, ignoring the danger, led a handful of soldiers against overwhelming enemy forces.VISIONARY: Seltkirk of Gulet, Demavend\\'s champion. When Vandergrift\\'s cohort cut him off from the rest of the army, he attacked the Visitor fearlessly. If you\\'re looking for a symbol of courage, find Seltkirk\\'s armor.Who were you then? GERALT: Who were you before?VISIONARY: What does it matter? Let the sins of youth fade into oblivion. Look at the candlelight. Feel it, and you\\'ll hear what it has to say to you.GERALT: I can\\'t hear a thing.VISIONARY: Then you\\'re not yet ready, but your time will come. You will then hear and understand. Trust me.You are Yahon. GERALT: I talked to the relic seller. I know you killed Sabrina.VISIONARY: That man died long ago. I\\'m no longer a soldier, murderer or coward. Sabrina set me free.Sure you\\'re not overdoing it with those candles? GERALT: Why do you need so many candles? Why not build a campfire?VISIONARY: This is Sabrina\\'s flame. Its light protects us and guides a soldier\\'s every step.GERALT: Did you rob a convoy of wax sellers?VISIONARY: I make the candles myself. I give them to anyone looking for protection within the flame of courage.GERALT: So long.[Geralt goes to see the relic seller]RELIC SELLER: Relics, artifacts, trinkets and talismans – hallowed and highly valuable!They say you have Yahon\\'s spear. GERALT: I know you have the spear Yahon used to pierce Sabrina\\'s heart.RELIC SELLER: He told you about that? And I thought the old freak was trying to forget the sins of his past.You know Yahon well? GERALT: You know Yahon well?RELIC SELLER: He despises me now, but things used to be different.RELIC SELLER: We were called up at the same time. We fought under Henselt together. But I managed, somehow, while he hated it. Why did they send him to that ferocious battle? He was the worst dumbass in the entire army but he outlived the best soldiers. Covered in shit, piss, snot and tears and still he survived.RELIC SELLER: He cracked when they burned Sabrina. A beautiful end to a fucking beautiful day. Then he went to the dogs. He pissed away all he had on drink. I was the fool who followed him and bought everything he pawned around the inns. That\\'s how I got the spear.Give me the spear. GERALT: I need that spear.RELIC SELLER: Tough luck, witcher. I last saw it a few years back.GERALT: What happened to it?RELIC SELLER: Look how similar we are. You want knowledge, I want coin. And we both need help to get what we want.GERALT: How much?RELIC SELLER: What are your customary takings on a contract? I\\'ll gladly accept but one half of that.All right then. GERALT: All right...RELIC SELLER: Great! Listen, then.Too much. GERALT: Too much.RELIC SELLER: How much you offering?[Not enough coin] RELIC SELLER: Are you jesting, witcher?[SUCCESS] RELIC SELLER: All right then.[AXII] Tell me about the spear. GERALT: Tell me about her. [FAILURE] RELIC SELLER: Seems we don\\'t see eye to eye. [SUCCESS] RELIC SELLER: After all... business is going well.[INTIMIDATION] Tell me, and we\\'ll part in peace. GERALT: Tell me what you know and we\\'ll part in peace.RELIC SELLER: You know the price. I can\\'t go any lower.[If Geralt hasn\\'t talked to the soldiers outside]  [FAILURE] GERALT: How about this...? You answer my questions and I won\\'t crush your balls.RELIC SELLER: Are you out of your mind? Know what\\'ll happen if you do that?GERALT: You won\\'t be able to fuck?RELIC SELLER: I supply this camp with food for the body and spirit. Wonder what they\\'ll do when there\\'s no fresh fish because of you? [SUCCESS] GERALT: You\\'ll have to go a lot lower when it turns out your business isn\\'t exactly crystal.RELIC SELLER: You\\'ve got nothing on me.GERALT: The camp\\'s full of pretty simple soldier folk. I mean, I doubt they\\'ll listen to reason when they learn one of the vendors has been chiseling them.RELIC SELLER: Bastard.GERALT: Right back at ya. Now talk.[If Geralt talked to the soldiers outside] GERALT: You\\'ll go out of business when I tell everyone you\\'re just a con artist.RELIC SELLER: Anyone can talk. You\\'d have to prove it.GERALT: As it happens, I found a nail at the execution site. A real one. Doesn\\'t look anything like that shiny scrap you\\'re peddling.RELIC SELLER: How did you manage to get there?GERALT: Some other time. Now, you talk.[PERSUASION] The king\\'s life depends on that spear. GERALT: The fate of your King depends on that spear. [FAILURE] RELIC SELLER: My king is His Highness, Oren the Great. [SUCCESS] RELIC SELLER: All right, since you put it that way.RELIC SELLER: You see... When Yahon lost his head for Sabrina, I bought the spear from the innkeeper. The donkey\\'s ass pawned it in the inn - he drank like a fish.RELIC SELLER: By then Yahon had already hidden in the hills, where no one dares to venture. Some call him the Visionary but in my book he\\'s just a nutter. Beats me why the beasts don\\'t attack him. A fisherman who supplies the canteen said that some monsters hate the smell of fish oil. Yahon makes candles out of it.GERALT: What did you do with the spear?RELIC SELLER: Sorry to say I lost it in a dice game. Shame, \\'cos today it\\'d fetch a good price. I lost the spear to a soldier, who later fought the Squirrels in the forests of the Pontar Valley. He told me he\\'d used it to kill some Scoia\\'tael big shot. I heard the shaft cracked as if there\\'d been some fucking jousting tournament.RELIC SELLER: The most interesting thing is, that big shot is still alive! I heard he\\'s now with that vixen from Aedirn. Some frigging commander. Elves are weird creatures. Who knows, maybe he still has that spearhead.GERALT: Iorveth.RELIC SELLER: You know him?GERALT: I\\'ll tell you for 100 orens.RELIC SELLER: Bah!  5.10 - CROSSING THE MISTS: VERGEN < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt talks to Dethmold about the rest of the artifacts he needs.]I know how to free the King of the curse. GERALT: I think I know how to free the King from his curse.DETHMOLD: Well, then, let\\'s get to work...GERALT: Can\\'t do anything until I have the spear the soldier stabbed Sabrina with. Problem is, it\\'s in the hands of a Scoia\\'tael commander named Iorveth.DETHMOLD: I know this Iorveth. Are you certain this is the spear?GERALT: Mhm. I last saw him back in Flotsam.DETHMOLD: Iorveth is in Vergen, witcher. Along with most of the Scoia\\'tael from the area. They\\'ve joined that peasant girl\\'s insurgency.GERALT: Iorveth, part of a peasant uprising? It doesn\\'t make sense...DETHMOLD: There\\'s only one way to confirm or disprove it. You must cross to the other side of the mist. What of the other artifacts? Do you know them all now?[If Geralt hasn\\'t learned about the other artifacts] GERALT: Not yet.DETHMOLD: In that case, you must wait until you\\'ve learned everything before crossing. It\\'s a dangerous voyage – not one to attempt twice, wouldn\\'t you say?GERALT: Yeah, I\\'d say...[If Geralt has learned about them] GERALT: There are two others in Vergen – the sword of The Visitor and the standard of the Dun Banner.I need to cross to the other side for the spear. GERALT: I\\'ve got to get through the mist, or I can\\'t lift the curse.DETHMOLD: I shall supply the white flag when you set out as our emissary... The lass is reputedly honorable. She\\'ll welcome you, invite you to a feast and, with a bit of luck, you may even plough her.GERALT: You\\'re sick, Dethmold.DETHMOLD: They say she\\'s very pretty. Peasant girls not to your liking?GERALT: Not your concern.DETHMOLD: In case the elves lack an understanding of diplomatic symbolism, please also take this armor. With His Majesty\\'s blessing, I might add.GERALT: A king\\'s concern can be boundless when his life depends on that of another.DETHMOLD: I spent some time working on this recently. This little marvel will guide you through the fog and provide a measure of protection from the specters.GERALT: Thanks.[On his way out of camp, Geralt runs into a morose Zoltan.]ZOLTAN: Good to see you, y\\'old rogue.GERALT: Why the long face, Zoltan?ZOLTAN: Everything\\'s fucked...GERALT: The only sight worse than a sad dwarf is the sight of a very sad dwarf.ZOLTAN: I don\\'t suppose you have any vodka?What\\'s bothering you? GERALT: I see things are worse than I thought.ZOLTAN: I feel like a monkey in a cage. Those pricks act as if they\\'ve never seen a dwarf before.Sure I\\'ve got vodka. GERALT: Might have.ZOLTAN: Wonderful! Life without old mates and booze is like a woman without a rump.Not on me. GERALT: Do I look like a liquor peddler?ZOLTAN: You\\'ve always enjoyed a tipple.There\\'s no time. GERALT: Only when I\\'ve had the time for that.ZOLTAN: Got yourself into deep shite again?I\\'d gladly drink with you, but not now. GERALT: Lemme tell you, Zoltan, I\\'d kill for a drink with you, too.ZOLTAN: What\\'s stopping you?GERALT: If I\\'m drunk, I just might not manage...ZOLTAN: That\\'s fucking worrying...GERALT: If you need a change of climate, come with me. I\\'m on my way to Vergen.ZOLTAN: You say that as if you\\'re going to the brothel round the corner. Forgetting about the specters?GERALT: I may have amnesia but I remember the curse.ZOLTAN: Well, all I get around here is \"nonhuman midget\" and the like... And I\\'ve dwarven brethren on that side. Sure as shit I\\'ll take Saskia over that prick Henselt, too. You really willing to help me cross?GERALT: Course.ZOLTAN: You know, Geralt, I\\'ve a feeling that Vergen\\'s where I should be.GERALT: I get you. Let\\'s go.ZOLTAN: How do you plan to get through the fog? Thought it was suicide to venture into it.GERALT: Dethmold gave me a protective amulet.ZOLTAN: Throw it out! I wouldn\\'t touch anything belonging to that dick.Trust me. GERALT: I had a choice - navigate the fog with an amulet or without it. Seemed safer with.ZOLTAN: You\\'re the expert on that magic shite, I guess.GERALT: Just trust me and stay close.ZOLTAN: Oh, what the hell! Better the devil you know... I\\'ll come with you.Let me explain. GERALT: The magical potential of the talisman will cause a local interference in the astral projection, creating disharmony where the two dimensions of reality meet.ZOLTAN: Er... meaning?GERALT: The mist should part to let us pass.ZOLTAN: You should\\'ve put it like that to begin with, instead of all that crap about astral bodies. I\\'ll go with you.[Geralt and Zoltan leave the camp.]ZOLTAN: I can\\'t wait to have some proper ale, instead of that piss water they drink in the Kaedweni camp. Thanks again, Geralt.GERALT: Tough crossing ahead of us, Zoltan.ZOLTAN: Lookin\\' to scare me now? We\\'re goin\\' and that\\'s that.[Geralt and Zoltan enter the fog and are immediately surrounded by wraiths. A purple orb from the amulet appears, showing the way.]GERALT: I see the path. The amulet is guiding us.ZOLTAN: You sure?GERALT: We can\\'t be sure of anything in this fog.ZOLTAN: You could have lied to make me feel better.[Geralt and Zoltan fight their way through the battling wraiths, following the amulet. They come out the other side of the mist.]ZOLTAN: Never again. Fuckin\\' fog.GERALT: Look at it this way - you\\'ll be able to brag about seeing the ghostly fog from the inside for the rest of your life!ZOLTAN: I\\'d rather brag about how I ploughed three wenches at once in my youth.[On the way, they encounter a party of Scoia\\'tael archers who block their path in the ruins of a burned-out village.]SCOIA\\'TAEL: Kill him!SCOIA\\'TAEL: Aediiiiiiiirn!ZOLTAN: Stop! You\\'re making a mistake.SCOIA\\'TAEL: A mistake? Interesting. There\\'s a war on - don\\'t know if you\\'ve noticed. And wars are won by killing foes. Or do I have it all wrong?ZOLTAN: The witcher\\'s a messenger! On his way to see Saskia.SCOIA\\'TAEL: Not your typical messenger...ZOLTAN: Well I don\\'t know if you noticed, but we had to pass through an atypical fog in which your typical messenger would\\'ve shit just before he...SCOIA\\'TAEL: Enough. We\\'ll not let you inside Vergen, but you can deliver your message to the commander of the watch. He\\'s stationed by the town gates.ZOLTAN: Ploughing typical elf. Come on, Geralt.[Geralt and Zoltan proceed to Vergen, where they are met at the gates by Yarpen Zigrin and Skalen Burdon.]YARPEN: Why it\\'s Geralt of Rivia and Zoltan Chivay... Pinch me, Burdon, for I believe I\\'ve dozed off while on duty.SKALEN: Could be an illusion, eh? Or some specters from the battlefield have lost their way? Maybe we ought to tickle them with an axe just to be sure?YARPEN: Ha ha! I\\'m afraid there\\'s no mage out there who could conjure up the witcher\\'s mug, nor the aroma of Zoltan\\'s beer-soaked beard. Heheh.ZOLTAN: Yarpen Zigrin! Lice eat me if I\\'m not delighted to see that horrid mug of yours!YARPEN: This lad here\\'s Skalen Burdon... Geralt! What are you doin\\' standing there as if you\\'ve swallowed a halberd? Got a hug for an old mate?Greetings. I\\'ve heard a lot about you. GERALT: Greetings. Triss has told me a lot about you.YARPEN: Wee Merigold?! Hah! How is the lass? Let me tell you, Skalen, this here witcher\\'s the very embodiment of chivalry. All the Seltkirks of the world can\\'t hold a candle to him. And you know why?SKALEN: No, but I got a feelin\\' we\\'re about to find out.I\\'m no knight... GERALT: Me, a knight? I\\'d sooner call Zoltan a show dancer.YARPEN: Well then, listen everyone. At the time, we were escortin\\' Kaedweni army convoys through the Shaerrawedd forests. Aye, aye - we served Henselt once, though always for coin... Anyways, the witcher was on the road as well, with Triss and Ciri, heading south.YARPEN: The lass, I tell you, was a demoness incarnate, pure pepper on her feet and healthy as a horse. But the sorceress fell ill. Some terrible pestilence held her, gave her the runs. That woman needed to go every five minutes. Never seen anythin\\' like it, and I\\'ve had my share of gut rumblings. This one time I roasted an old, ailing gerbil and...SKALEN: Oi! You promised us a chivalrous tale...YARPEN: And I\\'m deliverin\\' it, lad. In any case, the witcher would carry her into the bushes time after time. He treated and cared for her, cleaned her, bathed her...SKALEN: Sounds normal to me - a man lookin\\' after his woman. It\\'s too much to call it chivalrous, Yarpen...YARPEN: Hah! Wrong! Triss weren\\'t his woman - not his wife nor lover! She was sick and in need of aid! And he was on a secret mission, might\\'ve left her in some city, might\\'ve gone off on his own. But he didn\\'t... Know why? Because he\\'s got a heart of gold, he truly cares... A lad like you, Skalen, don\\'t know that bein\\' a knight\\'s not just about thrashing around in full plate, a long sword in hand. It\\'s not just about fightin\\' duels and winnin\\' tournaments.ZOLTAN: Damn, I missed hearin\\' your bullshit, Zigrin...GERALT: Hm, I don\\'t believe anyone else has tried to tell me that story.YARPEN: How is the wee Merigold, anyway?GERALT: Not great. The kingslayer kidnapped her.YARPEN: Oo. Damn the dogs, that\\'s downright terrible.SKALEN: I suppose it\\'s no coincidence you\\'re here...?Later, gentledwarves. I\\'m here on important business. GERALT: I\\'m afraid we\\'re in too big a hurry to stop and reminisce. We\\'re here on important business.[Gives same options to continue as \"This is no time for hugs.\"]This is no time for hugs. GERALT: We\\'re in a bit of a hurry. Got important matters to resolve.I need to meet with Saskia. GERALT: I have to see Saskia.YARPEN: To what end?GERALT: To dispel the mist of wraiths, I need a few magic artifacts.YARPEN: What\\'s Saskia got to do with that?GERALT: Her sword is one of those items.YARPEN: And what do you suggest I do? Iorveth and Saskia banned us from lettin\\' strangers in, and here are two old mates come over from the other side who want just that... A lose-lose situation, if I\\'ve ever seen one.ZOLTAN: That ought to be easy to get around.YARPEN: Cow pies ought to be easy to get around, yet we don\\'t always succeed...ZOLTAN: I\\'m staying here, Yarpen. I want to join you, enlist. Will you have me in the dwarven brigade?YARPEN: Will I have you, Chivay? Will I ploughin\\' have you? Why I\\'ll make you a fuckin\\' commander, you cocksucker! Problem solved. Skalen, you\\'re my witness - Zoltan\\'s no longer a stranger.SKALEN: Uh-huh...YARPEN: All right. Now I\\'ll introduce you to Saskia, and you can try to clarify the story with the sword for her. Or whatnot.ZOLTAN: Don\\'t you fret about the sword, Geralt. I promise to ascend to the fuckin\\' heights of oratory, be soft as a mink, cautious as a novice strumpet. I\\'ll get you that blade if I have to shave my beard off.YARPEN: All right, then. See that Skalen? We were headed for a tragedy...SKALEN: Now we\\'re headed for a comedy.YARPEN: Argh, youth these days. Lacking hope and heart. You know what Zoltan and I saw at Brenna, lad? To us, there\\'s no such thing as the impossible!I\\'m looking for a certain flag. GERALT: Any idea where I might find the Dun Banner?SKALEN: Try the nether world. The whole unit was cut down during the battle three years ago...GERALT: I meant the unit\\'s standard - which symbolizes death.SKALEN: Ah, that makes it a lot easier. We buried it with the remains of the Kaedwenis.GERALT: Where?SKALEN: Just outside Vergen... I\\'ll mark it on your map as the road could get confusing. Strange things are afoot in those crypts, witcher. Kaedweni ghosts scaring off our folk - that would be normal, since they were invaders. But one\\'s some kind of amateur historian, askin\\' all that venture there about the battle and the Dun Banner.GERALT: I\\'ll look into it. Thanks.Triss and the kingslayer might be in this area. GERALT: Triss could be somewhere in this area...YARPEN: The plague, I\\'ve not seen her five years, must be... Since that day they proclaimed you dead. Last saw her in Rivia, in any case.GERALT: From what I\\'ve been able to establish, the kingslayer forced her to teleport the two of them to this area. And she\\'s not on the other side of the fog.YARPEN: What did this kingslayer look like?GERALT: A huge, bald witcher. Wears a medallion with a snake on it.YARPEN: Sorry, Geralt, doesn\\'t even ring the tiniest bell, any of that...SKALEN: I might know something... This drunk in Vergen claims he saw a redhead fall from the sky somewhere among the ravines. And then he said the sorceress Philippa Eilhart came around looking for this woman.YARPEN: Shriveled old minx...SKALEN: She sent her servant and some peasants to the ravines after her, but they came back empty-handed. Now Philippa\\'s serving maid\\'s gone, leaving the sorceress angry as a wasp - she even turned one of the plebs into a pig.SKALEN: I spoke to one of those peasants. He claims the lass was no servant, but a Nilfgaardian agent, and she apparently found something in those ravines - maybe it was Triss, and maybe it was that witcher. Madame Eilhart, or the old minx, as Yarpen calls her, knows she\\'s been duped and can\\'t forgive herself for it.GERALT: Did the woman flee south? Deeper into Aedirn?YARPEN: Fuckin\\' hell, she came out the main gate not more than an hour ago. Headed straight for the fog. Thought she might be out to do some magic probing or whatnot...SKALEN: She knew a bit of magic. She might\\'ve crossed.GERALT: I guess I need to visit Shilard when I get back.Where\\'s Iorveth? GERALT: How\\'s Iorveth? Any chance I might run into him?SKALEN: Minimal. He follows Saskia around like a once neglected pup, eyes on her at all times.YARPEN: At least the lass is well-protected. What do you seek from Iorveth? Last I heard, you weren\\'t exactly chummy...GERALT: You heard right, but when I last saw him in Flotsam, he had something I need to lift the curse.ZOLTAN: Even if you see him, I doubt he\\'ll give you anything out of the kindness of his heart. Perhaps Saskia can convince him.GERALT: Guess I don\\'t have much of a choice.It\\'s time to act. We\\'ll chat another time. GERALT: It\\'s nice to talk to you all, but we\\'ve got things to do.ZOLTAN: Argh... That\\'s life. Open the gate. I\\'ve got to fetch me a certain sword.YARPEN: Wait a minute. If by some miracle you obtain that cursed blade, I\\'d advise you not to parade it out the main gate past the Squirrels...ZOLTAN: Got another solution?YARPEN: There\\'s another passage. I\\'ll mark it on the witcher\\'s map and show you myself. Sound all right to you?GERALT: It does. In the meantime, I\\'ll look around for that flag...ZOLTAN: Prime, I\\'d say.YARPEN: Off we go, then.  5.10.1 - DEATH SYMBOLIZED: THE DUN BANNER STANDARD < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt enters the dwarven catacombs and makes his way to the burial place of the Dun Banner. As he enters the room, a wraith manifests.]GHOST OF EKHART: Who are you and what do you seek?GERALT: Geralt of Rivia. I seek the standard of the Dun Banner. Who are you?EKHART: Ekhart Henessy - ensign and color bearer of the Dun Banner, the best force to issue from the land of Kaedwen.Killing you will be easiest. GERALT: Go back where you belong, corpse.[Geralt banishes Ekhart\\'s wraith.]I served in the Banner. GERALT: You may not remember me, but I remember you.EKHART: Where from?GERALT: I served in the Dun Banner.EKHART: Liar!GERALT: I fought beneath its standard at Brenna and at Vergen...[The ghost decides to test Geralt\\'s knowledge of the battle to prove his claim.][If Geralt gives a wrong answer] [If Geralt got the beaver hat from Zyvik] EKHART: If not for the beaver cap you wear, I would speak to you no longer. Try once more.[If Geralt did not get the hat or has answered wrong already] EKHART: You lie! You are not of the Dun Banner and you must die!EKHART: The Battle of Brenna... The Nordlings shoulder to shoulder against the Black Ones. The Redanians led by De Ruyter on the right... Natalis leading Temeria on the left. A splendid sight, was it not?You got it wrong. GERALT: You\\'re mistaken. The Redanian regiments were on the left, the Temerians took the center.EKHART: Correct. Perhaps you speak the truth...GERALT: Try me again.EKHART: Tell me, for this you must know... Who was chief commander of the Nilfgaardians at Brenna?Menno Coehoorn. GERALT: Menno Coehoorn.EKHART: I\\'m beginning to believe you. Menno Coehoorn... The repulsive head hound of the Nilfgaardian pack. But a great commander. He will again let the Nordlings\\' blood. Would you agree?Coehoorn is dead. GERALT: Your memory has suffered after death. Coehoorn perished. At Brenna.EKHART: You are vigilant. I could not deceive you.GERALT: Because I am of the Dun Banner.EKHART: Perhaps you did fight at Brenna... It was so long ago... I may have forgotten you... But Vergen is another matter...GERALT: I can\\'t answer for the state of your memory.EKHART: You are right... Memory often fails us after death. I cringe to admit I\\'ve forgotten who commanded the armies during the Battle of Vergen, perhaps the most important day of my life. And the last... Be so good as to remind me...Vandergrift and Seltkirk. GERALT: Seltkirk led Aedirn, Vandergrift led us.EKHART: Well done. Not all know that. Some believe that the kings commanded the armies during the battle... Or that their mages did...GERALT: Do you believe me yet?EKHART: Not yet, but I shall when you tell me how you survived the massacre at Vergen.I was led out by a priest. GERALT: Reverend Chrest led us out of the fire. He had a magic medallion that protected us from the flames.EKHART: Many survived?GERALT: Zyvik\\'s platoon.EKHART: Zyvik... The regiment\\'s best corporal.EKHART: You have proven that you served in the Dun Banner.GERALT: May I take the standard?EKHART: Why do you desire it so?GERALT: It will help me lift a curse.EKHART: Curses are of no import to me.GERALT: This one should be. It has stopped King Henselt\\'s army from advancing.EKHART: The Unicorn has returned?GERALT: He stands at Vergen\\'s gates. With your help, he\\'ll avenge the Dun Banner.EKHART: The standard lies in the sarcophagus. Take it. You will also find the sword of Colonel Gondor. Now, it is yours.GERALT: Thank you.EKHART: Where have you left your mount?GERALT: There are no horses here.EKHART: True. I would gladly drink with a brother from Brenna, but I am an unfettered soul, strong drink means nothing, tastes of nothing. Perhaps I miss that most in death. Guard the standard. I grasped it firmly even as they cut me down.[Geralt retrieves the standard and the Dun Banner sword from the sarcophagus, and leaves Zyvik\\'s hat on the tomb out of respect.]  5.10.2 - HATRED SYMBOLIZED: VANDERGRIFT\\'S SWORD < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt enters the Tunnel of the Founders and travels down to where he was meant to meet Zoltan. Zoltan is waiting for him - and so is Saskia.]GERALT: Zoltan, you were supposed to bring the sword...ZOLTAN: I failed, Geralt.SASKIA: That was not the best idea, witcher. Dwarves are poor liars in general, and that\\'s especially true of this one.GERALT: You know everything you need to know?SASKIA: Yes. You need the weapon to lift the curse from Henselt and free the souls of the fallen.GERALT: M\\'Lady, I know you\\'re at war with Henselt, but the curse threatens Vergen as well. It\\'s a field of uncontrollable magic energy...SASKIA: No need to exert yourself. I know this - the sword shall be yours.GERALT: Just like that?SASKIA: Yes. I\\'m glad to help and thank you on behalf of the Vergenis, the souls of whose loved ones will finally be granted the peace they have so long deserved.M\\'Lady, there is still time to withdraw. GERALT: M\\'Lady...SASKIA: I am no lady. My name is Saskia.GERALT: Saskia, I\\'ll need some time to lift the curse. Enough for you to fall back. The Scoia\\'tael and peasants can\\'t hope to defeat a professional army in open battle... Withdraw deeper into Aedirn.SASKIA: You underestimate them.GERALT: Looking to be another Aelirenn? Do you want them to die with your name on their lips? You know that\\'s what\\'ll happen if there\\'s a fight. The fighters will die quick deaths, but then Henselt\\'s men will enter the town. They\\'ll spare no one. They\\'ll kill the men, rape the women, turn the beautiful ones into slaves, and torture the rest to death...SASKIA: I have seen conquered cities and know the risks. Why do you aid Henselt? Why do you risk your life to lift this curse?I\\'m a witcher - I was created to do this. GERALT: It\\'s not up to me to judge rulers, good or bad. If there\\'s a curse, it needs to be dispelled. Not much room for politics or moral judgment.SASKIA: Yes, I know. You\\'re a hero, folk tell stories about you in taverns and troubadours describe your adventures in poems. But you\\'ve never known the whip, your children have never lost hands for stealing apples, you know not how it is to serve at a heavily laden feast table while your family awaits famished at home...SASKIA: You fail to understand me, for you make no moral judgments. I have no such restrictions and can thus warn you that Henselt is scum. Be cautious, take care of yourself and your friends. And I\\'ll not heed your advice. We\\'ll not flee, we\\'ll not surrender.GERALT: Farewell, Saskia.SASKIA: Farewell, witcher. And know that I hope never to have to face you in battle.GERALT: You can be sure of that, Saskia. I only fight monsters.I want to recover my memory. GERALT: I have my own agenda. A certain seer foretold that in lifting the curse I\\'d recover my memory. I\\'m certainly not Henselt\\'s devoted follower.SASKIA: In that case, join my forces.GERALT: I can\\'t. I have certain obligations on the other side... Friends who remained in Henselt\\'s camp. Friends I can\\'t leave behind.SASKIA: I, too, have obligations that prevent me from fleeing or withdrawing. I cannot disappoint all those who placed their trust in me. Go where you must and hope your obligations don\\'t drive you to fight me.GERALT: I\\'m no soldier, Saskia. You can be sure of that.SASKIA: Time will tell. Farewell, witcher, and look after your friends. Henselt is a true rogue.I won\\'t explain myself to you. GERALT: I refuse to explain myself.SASKIA: So be it. And I\\'ll not heed your advice. Good luck with the curse.ZOLTAN: See you, you old prick. Don\\'t let them Kaedwenize you and don\\'t get killed.GERALT: That goes for you, too, Zoltan. Farewell to you both.Good luck and farewell. GERALT: Thank you and good luck. See you, Zoltan, and don\\'t get killed.ZOLTAN: Nor you, you old prick. See you again... some day.ZOLTAN: Eh-em. Saskia, I forgot one wee thing. Geralt wishes to meet with Iorveth. He\\'s got dealings with the elf...GERALT: I need the head of the spear used to finish off Sabrina as she uttered the curse... Iorveth had it when we ran into each other in Flotsam.SASKIA: He lost it playing dice. Skalen now has the spearhead. The young Burdon is a gambler, an addict, and perhaps Vergen\\'s top sharp. You should speak to him.GERALT: Iorveth put that spearhead up as a bet?SASKIA: When it comes to getting folk to sit down to a game of poker, Skalen can be convincing. His pack is bulging with treasures - you\\'d be surprised. All won at dice.GERALT: I won\\'t need convincing. We\\'ll see how he does against me. Farewell to you both.  5.10.3 - THE SPEAR OF DESTINY < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to find Skalen.]GERALT: I heard you have the head of Iorveth\\'s spear.SKALEN: I do, indeed.GERALT: I could use that spearhead.SKALEN: Not a chance in hell. It\\'s my trophy. Won it off the greatest killer among elves. In certain circles that makes me a hero...GERALT: What were you playing?SKALEN: Dice poker.GERALT: I\\'ve rolled a few dice in my time...SKALEN: Do I hear a challenge?GERALT: Mhm.SKALEN: I trust you\\'ll not ask me for a handicap. Though I must warn you, I aim to be merciless - curse or no curse.GERALT: Let\\'s begin.[If Geralt loses] GERALT: Rematch?SKALEN: With pleasure.[If Geralt wins] SKALEN: You play like a true sharp. Almost like a cheat... But true to my word, the spearhead\\'s yours.GERALT: Thanks, Skalen. I heard you have a few more interesting trinkets I could win off you...SKALEN: I could find something.  5.11 - WHERE IS TRISS MERIGOLD? < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Having finished his business in Vergen, Geralt crosses the mists again. In the mists, he finds the body of a Nilfgaardian soldier with a letter from Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen on him; the order is for the capture of Triss Merigold. When he emerges from the mist he finds several Blue Stripes looking over the bodies of several Nilfgaardians.]ROCHE: Good, you\\'re here. The Nilfgaardians attacked us.GERALT: Any idea why?ROCHE: They were loitering around here, staring into the fog as if waiting for something. I summoned Fenn, Silas and a few others, and told Ves to cover us from a distance while we went to talk to them. So I asked the black dogs, courteously, why they were gazing into the fog as if the emperor himself was about to emerge from it. No answer. But I can see the anger, knitted brows, faces reddening... And they start growling to each other in that dog\\'s tongue of theirs.ROCHE: A woman came out of the mist. Beautiful and barely alive, she dropped to the ground, and a small object slipped from her hand... It was a jade figurine, no larger than a man\\'s hand. If I didn\\'t know it was impossible, I\\'d say it was Triss turned into a statuette.GERALT: It is possible - artifact compression. Where\\'s this woman?ROCHE: I dunno. The girl growled at the soldiers and all hell broke loose. The Black Ones jumped us and she ran off towards the camp.GERALT: I need to follow her.ROCHE: We\\'re going with you. Fall in![As Geralt and the Stripes approach the Nilfgaardian camp, they see a ship with black sails departing.]ROCHE: We\\'re too late.GERALT: Is the Percival ready to sail?ROCHE: It is, but they will not let us go. Henselt has plans of his own.GERALT: I couldn\\'t give a shit about Henselt. Shilard has Triss, and I need to save her.ROCHE: It\\'s not an option. They\\'ll not let us sail until you lift the curse, and we\\'ve no chance of catching the Nilfgaardians on foot. If they wanted to kill her, she\\'d be dead already.ROCHE: Besides which we know where they\\'ve gone. Loc Muinne, witcher. The monarchs and mages are to meet and decide the fate of the known world. You will find Triss there, I promise.[Roche and the Stripes leave as the ship disappears. Inside Shilard\\'s tent, Geralt finds a letter to the emperor about the emissary\\'s mage and a book with a poem about the Wild Hunt.]  5.12 - BREAKING HENSELT\\'S CURSE < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to meet with Henselt.]HENSELT: At last! Have you got Sabrina\\'s spear?GERALT: Not only that. I\\'ve got all three artifacts.HENSELT: You won\\'t regret it. Let\\'s do some magic!GERALT: Easy... First I have to see Dethmold.HENSELT: What for?To play cards. GERALT: We agreed to play cards.HENSELT: Remember this... I need you now, but that doesn\\'t make you irreplaceable. Another remark like that and you\\'ll have your own slow-burning stake, and I piss on whether you curse me or observe a proud silence as you roast.GERALT: We\\'ll need some magic powder to perform the exorcisms.HENSELT: Argh, I\\'m beginning to have enough of this magic nonsense.GERALT: Magic can only be defeated by magic, Your Majesty.HENSELT: All right, but make haste. I\\'ll wait for you by the stake.[Geralt goes to obtain the magic dust from Dethmold.]I could use some magic dust. GERALT: I need magic powder to mark out the runes.DETHMOLD: Are you aware that the formula requires powdered camphor resin?GERALT: I am.DETHMOLD: Then you must also know that the resin is extremely valuable.Henselt will pay you. GERALT: Get Henselt to pay you. I need the powder to do the exorcism, reverse the prophecy and release him from the curse.DETHMOLD: You should have said. I\\'ll give you as much as you need.GERALT: Thanks, on the King\\'s behalf.You\\'ll get nothing from me. GERALT: Well I can\\'t pay you, so just give it up.DETHMOLD: You\\'re pressing your luck.GERALT: Maybe it\\'s because my services are worth no less than camphor resin.DETHMOLD: Out of my sight before I lose my patience!GERALT: You never asked why I needed the powder.DETHMOLD: Why, then?GERALT: For the exorcisms that\\'ll release your King from his curse.DETHMOLD: I\\'ve one more thing you might find useful.GERALT: What\\'s that?DETHMOLD: You asked me for protective runes. I\\'ve done better. Take this grimoire, which details many. I believe there\\'s even one for syphilis. I\\'ve marked my recommendations.GERALT: Thanks.[Inside the grimoire is a diagram of seven vertexes placed over a goat\\'s skull. Geralt takes the dust and the grimoire and meets Henselt at the site of Sabrina\\'s execution.]GERALT: She died here.HENSELT: And pissed and shat as she did.GERALT: Evil place... You can feel it in the air. Those candles don\\'t help any, either.HENSELT: They\\'ve gone mad. Someone said the bitch died a martyr and now the common folk burn candles for her.GERALT: I have to observe this place from a distance.HENSELT: During the execution, I was on that hill. I\\'ll show ya.[Geralt climbs up to the hill overlooking the wheel with Henselt.]GERALT: Flat area, that\\'s good.HENSELT: Are you concerned for your feet?GERALT: Your Majesty, you need to draw runic protective signs around the stake.HENSELT: Magic signs are the domain of witchers, not kings. Correct me if I\\'m wrong.There\\'s no time to explain. GERALT: There\\'s no time to explain.HENSELT: I\\'m the one who decides what we do and don\\'t have time for.GERALT: The runes must be created by the one afflicted by the curse.HENSELT: You should have said so earlier.To lift the curse, you have to draw a circle. GERALT: It\\'s important that you draw the circle yourself, Your Majesty.HENSELT: Important for whom?GERALT: It was your death Sabrina foretold, so who d\\'you think?HENSELT: All right. Tell me what we do.GERALT: To lift the curse, we have to reenact the events from three years ago.HENSELT: How do you wish to do that if half of those involved lie rottin\\' with the worms?GERALT: It\\'s about the energy of that time. The energy of the woman who cast the curse, combined with the energy of its victim.HENSELT: *Ptooey*GERALT: When you get the runic signs right, Sabrina\\'s ghost will appear.HENSELT: Bring the bitch to life. It\\'ll be a pleasure to put my spear in her...GERALT: Remember to stab her in exactly the same spot as that soldier did, but earlier this time. Before the sorceress completes the curse.HENSELT: I\\'ll look for the hole... But how am I to know when?GERALT: When you realize that the curse concerns you. But be ready, she may use a different name.HENSELT: Is that all?GERALT: For you, then I take over. Specters might appear during the exorcism.HENSELT: Might, or will?GERALT: It depends on Sabrina\\'s aura in the spirit world.HENSELT: I wager ghosts loathe the cunt. Let\\'s get it over with. Tell me what I\\'m to draw.GERALT: You have to go down there, Your Majesty.HENSELT: What about you?GERALT: I\\'ll guide you. I have a good view from up here.[Henselt goes down to the pyre, where the offerings are laid out around the base of the wheel.]GERALT: Pour the powder towards the petrified bread loaf, Your Majesty!GERALT: Head towards the black candles, Your Majesty.GERALT: Now go towards the goat skull, Your Majesty.GERALT: Now towards the burnt tree!GERALT: Find the raven\\'s corpse, Your Majesty!GERALT: Now spread the powder and head for the stone bowl.GERALT: Go towards the pixie ring, Your Majesty![As Henselt goes, trailing the dust behind him, the shape of the goat skull is drawn on the ground.]GERALT: Sire, form a large, even circle, at a good distance from the pyre.HENSELT: It\\'s turned out beautifully. Pity the wind will soon scatter it.GERALT: The evil power of the curse came from the fire. Fire\\'s a hard element to tame and this one had added potency... it consumed the body of the one casting the curse.HENSELT: Enough of these phantasmagorias, as Dethmold puts it. Look at my boots!GERALT: Stay in the circle, Your Majesty.HENSELT: The powder reeks of dwarven dung.[Geralt comes down from the hill and casts Igni to light the lines of magic dust. Wraiths spring up from the lines, and Sabrina\\'s ghost appears lashed and wailing to the wheel. Henselt\\'s soldiers cry out and flee.]GERALT: It\\'s begun. You have some brave soldiers, Your Majesty.HENSELT: They\\'re scared of ghosts, as we all are! Curses, there\\'s hundreds of them!GERALT: Calm down, Your Majesty, we\\'re protected by the magic runes. The ghosts won\\'t get past the barrier.HENSELT: I\\'m not afraid of people, but those ploughing creatures have begun to bother me.GERALT: You\\'re safe if you stay within the runes.HENSELT: What should I do?GERALT: When the sorceress calls your name, you have to show mercy and end her suffering with the spear.[Henselt goes to kneel in front of the pyre.]GERALT: You\\'ve broken the circle! Specters could get through.HENSELT: What shall we do?GERALT: I\\'ll take care of them. You finish the exorcism, Your Majesty.[As Geralt attacks the wraiths, Sabrina\\'s ghost begins speaking.]SABRINA: By blood and fire! Let it be so by blood and fire!SABRINA: Let a shooting star split the heavens and mark its mortal journey with a trail of blood! Let fools be duped by the sight of fish scales turned by magic into square pieces of gold! Let the Unicorn violate thousand year-old rules!SABRINA: By the pain and power of fire devouring air, by the charred bones of the innocent, let the prophecy be fulfilled!SABRINA: You will die in accordance with my prophecy! You cannot escape your fate.SABRINA: Curse you, Henselt!GERALT: Now, Your Majesty![Henselt grips the spear and stabs Sabrina in the chest. She shrieks, and the lines of the circle stop glowing as she and the wraiths evaporate.]GERALT: It worked.HENSELT: Are ya sure?GERALT: All I can say for sure is that a dwarf can pass between a troll\\'s legs, even on tiptoe. But I think it went well.HENSELT: Good! For me and for you. But all the worse for Aedirn.I\\'ve separated you from the curse, but it remains active. I\\'ll have to deal with it. GERALT: I\\'ve separated you from the curse, but it remains active and powerful. The specters of the fallen continue to fight in the fields outside Vergen....HENSELT: You\\'ll find a way, like you did with that charcoaled slut.We have Saskia to thank for this. GERALT: You owe your freedom from the curse to Saskia\\'s generosity. You should send a delegation to thank her, Your Majesty.HENSELT: I\\'ll thank her in person once you disperse the fog of specters from the battlefield.GERALT: That\\'ll be much harder.HENSELT: I have faith in you and faith can move mountains.GERALT: Funny you say that. I need an artifact symbolizing faith.HENSELT: Yes, Dethmold told me. I\\'ll give you the medallion. First, I must have a drink. Come to my tent, I\\'ll roll out my best wine. You deserve it.[When Geralt arrives at Henselt\\'s tent, three Redanian soldiers are clustered outside, and inside is a Redanian messenger.]HENSELT: I\\'m glad you\\'re here. A messenger from Redania arrived this morning. Read.MESSENGER: The King of Redania, Radovid the Fifth, son of Vizimir and Hedwig from Malleore, the heir...HENSELT: Get to the point.MESSENGER: The point is, it\\'s not true that after the death of King Foltest, Temeria will be inherited... In truth, Foltest left a lawful heir.HENSELT: Who\\'s this heir?[If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Adda is dead] MESSENGER: Due to the tragic death of Prince Boussy, his sister, Anais, will inherit the Temerian crown.HENSELT: Witcher, you fought in the battles for the La Valettes\\' fortress. Tell me, how old is this princess?She\\'s only a child. GERALT: She\\'s too young to rule.Give her a few years and she\\'ll be able to rule. GERALT: She\\'s only a child, but she\\'ll grow to take the throne.HENSELT: Throne?HENSELT: Remind me, who\\'s her mother?Anais is a bastard. GERALT: Anais is bastard offspring.HENSELT: That\\'s it! Bastards cannot be heirs.Foltest wanted to recognize her as his own. GERALT: She is the King\\'s daughter. Foltest wanted to recognize her as his own.HENSELT: The Foltest I remember would never do that.HENSELT: If you counted all the bastards I begat, I could fill all the thrones of the North.[If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Adda alive] MESSENGER: Queen Adda – daughter of King Foltest and wife of Radovid.HENSELT: Adda? Everyone knows she was the fruit of incest. If my memory serves, Geralt, she\\'s under a curse, isn\\'t she?I\\'ve lifted that curse. GERALT: That was true, Foltest\\'s daughter was a striga, but I managed to lift the curse. Or else Radovid wouldn\\'t have wed her.HENSELT: It appears you removed that curse twice.And I\\'ll lift it again if I have to. GERALT: Third time lucky.HENSELT: Third, fourth... maybe fifteenth!The second was the final time. GERALT: The curse has been lifted, Your Majesty.HENSELT: I\\'d like to believe that.HENSELT: Adda could yet savor human flesh again.You\\'ve been cursed too, King. GERALT: It\\'s no worse than Your Majesty\\'s curse.HENSELT: I don\\'t run around the castle devouring people.HENSELT: Tell King Radovid that I will not honor a monster with a royal title. If Redania doesn\\'t wish...HENSELT: What the hell\\'s going on?! Guards![An assassin wearing a snake medallion slits the throat of the messenger and throws a knife at Henselt. Geralt deflects the knife with his own blade; the assassin draws twin swords from his back and leaps at Geralt. Geralt repels him with Aard; he recovers with a somersault and is joined outside the tent by a second Viper witcher. Geralt manages to slay one of them, then a lightning bolt from Síle misses the other; he notices the magic and flees.]SÍLE: Who are they?HENSELT: They wanted to kill me! Me! Hah! The scum! Witcher, we must talk.HENSELT: Dethmold said you needed this medallion. You saved my life and I\\'m not nearly as ungrateful as some might say. You\\'ll receive the pendant in due time.SÍLE: Pity none could be taken alive.DETHMOLD: Don\\'t fret, Tansarville. There are ways to make a dead man speak.SÍLE: I know those methods. Necromancy is forbidden.DETHMOLD: In the absence of the Council and the Conclave, it\\'s hard to know what is forbidden. What would you say, Your Majesty?HENSELT: I want to know everything. Plough that corpse if you have to. Do anything it takes!DETHMOLD: Necromancy, Your Majesty, is a branch of magic...HENSELT: I don\\'t care. Do as you\\'re told.SÍLE: Count me out.DETHMOLD: Ah, as the common folk say, \"Be at ease, the woman\\'s gone.\" I\\'ll need your help, witcher. You know where to find me.HENSELT: It\\'s never-ending! I\\'m the bloody King, but she mumps and sulks like some common servant was trying to grope her.Síle has her principles. GERALT: Not every sorcerer is like Dethmold. Many don\\'t like messing with corpses.HENSELT: As long as she\\'s in my camp, she\\'ll do as I say!Burn her at the stake, like you did Sabrina. GERALT: You could always turn her into another Kaedweni saint.HENSELT: And get hit with the same dung again? I hope you\\'re jesting. Everything had better change when they appoint a new Council and Conclave. Otherwise, damn it, I will light up the stakes again. Like Demavend!That\\'s not my concern. GERALT: I\\'d better go.HENSELT: Go. Dethmold is probably biting his nails in anticipation.  5.13 - ASSASSINS OF KINGS: SERRIT AND AUCKES < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to join Dethmold in the medic\\'s tent, where he has the dead assassin laid out on the table.]DETHMOLD: Geralt of Rivia... Ready for the ride of your life?Can you perform the ritual without me? GERALT: Can\\'t handle this without me?DETHMOLD: You\\'re a mutant, like this killer. An ordinary man would never survive Hanmarvyn\\'s Blue Dream. You must drink a potion that will increase your heart\\'s efficiency and strengthen your blood vessels. Hallucinogenic properties are also welcome, as they will enhance the vision...GERALT: Gadwall should do it.How does this ritual work? GERALT: Necromancy\\'s awfully fishy. What do you aim to do?DETHMOLD: Hanmarvyn\\'s Blue Dream is a spell that grants you a glimpse of a dead man\\'s memories. You\\'ll see, feel and taste what the killer experienced in his life. As a mutant, the operation isn\\'t at all dangerous for you.I need some time. GERALT: I need to do something before we begin.DETHMOLD: Have a drink, plough a girl, do something to relax... whatever it takes.Let\\'s get this ritual going. [If Geralt has not drunk the potion] DETHMOLD: You look your normal self. Have you had your fill of fortifying potions? It would be foolish if you died due to a simple oversight...GERALT: Not just yet. I need to prepare. Gadwall should do it.[If Geralt has drunk the potion] GERALT: I\\'m ready.DETHMOLD: Wonderful! The Blue Dream can be very useful, although it only lets you see the killer\\'s recent past.GERALT: Hope it\\'s worth it.DETHMOLD: Pay attention to every detail. Places, names... everything.GERALT: Got it.DETHMOLD: Let\\'s begin!DETHMOLD: Veki ner\\'zan zala![The scene changes to the ravines, where Geralt, in the head of Auckes, is following the other assassin, Serrit.]SERRIT: I nearly got lost in that fog.AUCKES: Look at it this way - nobody\\'ll find us here.SERRIT: Unless Henselt attacks Vergen despite the mist.AUCKES: Henselt\\'s not going to attack anyone ever again.SERRIT: Always the optimist, Auckes.[If a wrong turn is taken, Geralt resurfaces.]DETHMOLD: You wriggled like a fish in a net. What happened?GERALT: One more time... I was so close.DETHMOLD: Damn it! All right, close your eyes.DETHMOLD: Veki ner\\'zan zala![Serrit and Auckes make their way through the ravine to a stone door, which leads into a tunnel system.]SERRIT: Follow in my footsteps.AUCKES: I love these traps.SERRIT: I know, I do too.SERRIT: Henselt behaves as if he wants to help us.AUCKES: What d\\'you mean?SERRIT: You\\'ve seen him, he loves playing the soldier. He\\'s everywhere. He\\'s reckless.AUCKES: Letho will want him assassinated like the others.SERRIT: Finally, some action. We\\'ve been skulking in these caves like bats.AUCKES: I\\'d rather be like a bat than slain by the King\\'s mercenaries.SERRIT: What is it, Auckes? Scared?AUCKES: I heard Dethmold never lets Henselt out of his sight. And now a witcher\\'s arrived in their camp.SERRIT: One of him - three of us.AUCKES: But you know who it is.SERRIT: I know, dammit, but don\\'t let it get to you.AUCKES: It\\'s Triss Merigold who worries me.SERRIT: If she betrays that Síle ordered us to get rid of Demavend, things will get out of hand. Letho should kill her.AUCKES: He should, but apparently he only kills kings.[Auckes and Serrit arrive at a campfire where Letho is waiting.]LETHO: Here at last.SERRIT: They\\'re guarding the camp like it was a princess\\' chastity.LETHO: Did you learn anything?AUCKES: The White Wolf has arrived at the Kaedweni camp with Vernon Roche.SERRIT: Looks like he\\'s Henselt\\'s lackey now.LETHO: I\\'d rather Henselt used others as his lackeys.He doesn’t remember anything. AUCKES: With his amnesia, we\\'re safe.LETHO: Not so. That\\'s exactly what makes him so dangerous.But they thought he killed Foltest. AUCKES: I thought he was hanged for killing Foltest.LETHO: You want him hanged?AUCKES: No.LETHO: We have to be careful. Especially now we\\'ve broken off with Iorveth and his bunch.SERRIT: There\\'s something else: Síle de Tansarville.AUCKES: You\\'re right. Our sorceress is playing hard.SERRIT: De Tansarville has done her job. We don\\'t need her anymore.LETHO: We won\\'t kill her. Not just yet.AUCKES: You know best.LETHO: That\\'s right. The main thing now is to get rid of Henselt. You\\'ll go soon.AUCKES: What about you?LETHO: I\\'m heading to Loc Muinne. That\\'s where things will be decided. We\\'ll meet again soon, if you\\'re careful.AUCKES: To drink a jug of wine and laugh about it?LETHO: Who knows.[The scene changes to just outside Henselt\\'s camp.]SERRIT: I\\'ll take the palisade, we\\'ll meet by the cave entrance.[Auckes sneaks into the camp and kills a guard from behind. The scene changes again, to inside the cave that Serrit told Auckes to meet him in.]AUCKES: Loc Muinne?SERRIT: The mages plan to appoint a new Council and Conclave. All the bigwigs of the North will be there.AUCKES: Imagine. Kings, sorceresses...SERRIT: We\\'re here.[In the next vision, Auckes and Serrit fight a group of guards outside Henselt\\'s tent.]SERRIT: That\\'s all of them. What is it?AUCKES: I thought I saw Síle.SERRIT: Let\\'s go.[The next thing Geralt sees is himself, killing Auckes. He resurfaces from the vision.]DETHMOLD: Wake up. I\\'m dying to hear everything. What did you find out?I know the location of their hideout. GERALT: They\\'re hiding in the ravines.DETHMOLD: The other one\\'s probably fled there.GERALT: Our dead man should have a key on him.DETHMOLD: D\\'you remember anything else?Síle\\'s helping them. GERALT: They said Síle de Tansarville was an accomplice in the murder.DETHMOLD: Síle! She was here while you were lying in a trance. She said she\\'d follow the second assassin.DETHMOLD: D\\'you remember anything else?I\\'ve got to go. GERALT: There\\'s no time to waste. I\\'ll follow them.DETHMOLD: Good luck, Geralt.[Geralt goes to the kingslayers\\' hideout, where he finds two gargoyles and a golem - and evidence of magic. In the room where the campfire had been, he finds Serrit lying in a pool of blood.]SERRIT: Geralt...GERALT: Serrit!SERRIT: Síle knew... She wants to destroy the evidence...GERALT: What evidence?SERRIT: We didn\\'t want to leave you...GERALT: What are you talking about?SERRIT: Nearly made it... Just think! The Wild Hunt...We could\\'ve freed the world of the omen of war...[Geralt slips into a flashback. NGERALT, NARRATING: September 13, 1269 – The Ravine of the Hydra.

I don’t know what the riders of the Hunt were looking for.\\xa0November 23, 1269 – Cintra, the village of Coldwater, and another victim of the Hunt – an eleven-year-old boy. His parents didn’t even ask if he had a chance. I\\'m tired.\\xa0February 24, 1270 – A high pass in the Armush Mountains. An imperial manticore – one of the world’s oldest and deadliest monsters.

The Hunt continues to race south. Since I’ve been following them, they’ve taken 23 individuals. All between the ages of ten and twenty. All except for Yennefer.][Geralt returns to Dethmold.]DETHMOLD: Did you get him?GERALT: Síle got to him first. He\\'s dead.DETHMOLD: The bitch! She\\'s probably on the other side of the mist by now. Come on, witcher, we\\'ve got to remove that damn curse. I got the medallion from the King - the one you were looking for. Here...  5.14 - THE ETERNAL BATTLE < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to Dethmold.]GERALT: I\\'m ready to lift the curse. I\\'ve got all the artifacts.DETHMOLD: Then there is a chance we will soon move against Aedirn and you will recover your memory.GERALT: I\\'ll need your help, sorcerer, to find the right ghosts.DETHMOLD: Ah, they will find you. The artifacts\\' aura will lure them. Allow them to think, speak and act, then you will know what to do.DETHMOLD: Geralt, there\\'s something else out there... I scanned the battlefield and noticed the Visitor\\'s ghost. It\\'s different from the others, it\\'s changed.GERALT: A draug. I expected as much.DETHMOLD: Uhm. Good luck, witcher.[Geralt enters the mist. One of the specters possesses him.]AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: It\\'s warm...AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 2: A lovely autumn. I bet the fruit is plentiful.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: We won\\'t be the ones pickin\\' it.AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: You\\'ll be picking enemy heads. Today.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: No reason to wait. Slaughter the Kaedweni mutts!AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Wait! The time\\'s not right.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 2: Sometimes I forget what we\\'re fighting for.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: Powerful kings have no choice but to wage wars.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 2: Then why don\\'t Demavend and Henselt duel to settle things?! My brother-in-law is from Kaedwen. A decent fellow.AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: Once I was at a market there. Quality goods - cheaper than our merchants\\', too.AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Bloody hell, shut it! Every Kaedweni is a bastard! Do you know what they\\'ll do to our women if we lose this battle?!AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 1: Have you forgotten that they\\'ve come to pillage, burn and steal our land?! Are we to give it away?!AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: Whoresons\\' seed! At \\'em!AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: No! Wait for the signal!AEDIRNIAN SOLDIER 3: There\\'s no time to lose!AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Silence! Archers! Light your arrows! Aim at the first ditch![The arrows fly.]AEDIRNIAN OFFICER: Get them! Capture the enemy standard![Across the field, a draug made of the enemy\\'s standard bearer assembles itself. Geralt, in the form of the Aedirnian soldier, defeats it. The ghost leaves him, and a Kaedweni ghost possesses him next.]KAEDWENI OFFICER: The standard\\'s in enemy hands! We\\'re sitting ducks here! You need to tell the commander we were ambushed. We can\\'t hold without reinforcements!KAEDWENI SOLDIER: I\\'m to tell him?!KAEDWENI OFFICER: No, Princess Syphilis! Move it, imbecile, before they slaughter us to a man!KAEDWENI SOLDIER: I shan\\'t make it... First battle... Killed my first man... Got blood on my hands...[Arrows rain down on the Kaedweni soldiers.]KAEDWENI OFFICER: Take cover! They\\'re shooting!KAEDWENI OFFICER: Run, you fool! Deliver the message![Geralt, in the form of the soldier, runs across the battlefield to the commander.]KAEDWENI OFFICER: Cease shooting! He\\'s one of ours![Geralt approaches a massive draug, created from the ghost of Vandergrift, the Visitor.]GERALT: My Lord, the leader of the Dun Banner sent me. We were ambushed! We can\\'t hold!VANDERGRIFT: Weren\\'t your scouts keenly watching the battlefield, captain?KAEDWENI SOLDIER: Yes, sir! They must have dug those ditches in the night, the field was clear by day. Lady Glevissig scanned it with her magic during the night.VANDERGRIFT: Ten lashes to each scout, hang every third one.GERALT: My lord, we need support.VANDERGRIFT: There will be no reinforcements. You must hold. And you, Glevissig... I\\'ll settle this after the battle. The King will learn of your incompetence.SABRINA: Battles are won or lost by the commanders, not by sorceresses. Remember, I\\'ll make a report, too, and...VANDERGRIFT: I\\'ve finished talking to you, witch. Time to win this battle. My Lords, to your banners! We enter the fray!SABRINA: Maybe you\\'ve finished with me, but that doesn\\'t mean I\\'ve finished with you.[The soldier\\'s ghost releases Geralt, and he watches as Sabrina steps away and casts a spell, planting her staff in the ground.]SABRINA: Nadovessiveg.[Philippa, Síle, and two other sorceresses manifest.]PHILIPPA: How can we help you, Sabrina?SABRINA: My place at Henselt\\'s court is threatened. Furthermore, if Vandergrift wins the battle, nothing will stop Henselt from taking Upper Aedirn.PHILIPPA: The balance of power in the North will be upset. What do you intend?SABRINA: I shall summon Melgar\\'s Fire to the battlefield. It will kill Vandergrift and weaken both sides.PHILIPPA: Any use of unconventional weapons may be severely censured.SABRINA: I\\'m aware of that.PHILIPPA: Henselt\\'s hegemony is counter to the Lodge\\'s plans. We will help you, but remember... in the event that you fail, you\\'ll be on your own.SABRINA: I am ready.[The ghost of Seltkirk dispatches a Kaedweni soldier.]SELTKIRK: That\\'s all you\\'ve got?! You\\'re dying fast, like roaches under my boot! Is there a Kaedweni to match Seltkirk of Gulet on this field?![Seltkirk\\'s ghost possesses Geralt. He fights his way through Kaedweni wraiths until he reaches an open field where the Kaedweni standard bearer awaits. Geralt tears free from the ghost\\'s influence.]SELTKIRK: The Visitor! I\\'ve long awaited this meeting.GERALT: Leave, ghost.SELTKIRK: I\\'ll not give up an opportunity to duel Vandergrift.GERALT: He will kill you.SELTKIRK: Seltkirk does not fear death.GERALT: When you die, your soldiers will die every day afterwards. Forever... Leave! This is a task for a witcher, not a knight.SELTKIRK: I do this solely for my men.[Seltkirk leaves, and Geralt defeats the standard bearer.]KAEDWENI STANDARD BEARER: Mercy...VANDERGRIFT: You have failed me.GERALT: Who are you?VANDERGRIFT: Hah! Your nightmare![Geralt defeats the draug. Around the battlefield, Sabrina\\'s meteors begin to fall.]SELTKIRK: Should have stayed at home, Vandergrift. Cursed mages! To die after such a victory! Gods! We can\\'t fight such sorcery.CHREST: It\\'s sorcerous hail! Unclean fire! We\\'re doomed!KAEDWENI SOLDIER 1: Why are they doing this?!CHREST: As the prophecy sayeth, \"And the time will come when sorceresses turn on men, flaming balls rain from the sky and destruction will be unleashed!\"KAEDWENI SOLDIER 2: What should we do? Wait here for death?!CHREST: I shall lead you, as a shepherd leads his flock, safely from the dark abyss![Reverend Chrest\\'s ghost possesses Geralt. He leads the Kaedweni soldiers to King Henselt\\'s position near the edge of the mist.]CHREST: Stop firing! Our men are dying! A massacre! Save us, Sire!HENSELT: Sabrina, is that your work?SABRINA: Order your troops forward, Your Majesty. The Aedirnian army is routed.HENSELT: Not only the Aedirnian. Look at that terrified horde - this very morning they were the finest of my knights.SABRINA: They\\'ll make it if they\\'re reinforced.HENSELT: Who allowed you to use magic?SABRINA: Sire, if you strike now, Lormark will be yours!HENSELT: You\\'ve tainted my honor, brought death to dozens of knights...SABRINA: Sire, the battle was lost...HENSELT: You put me to shame before Demavend. His troops fought like men of honor should - to the end. Sabrina Glevissig, I sentence you to death. You shall burn at the stake.HENSELT: I will return to claim my birthright...[Geralt experiences a flashback.  GERALT, NARRATING: July 25, 1270 – The forests of Angren. \"No mighty mortal, no heap of meat or strongman can parry the strike of the slyzard\\'s tail...\" Letho couldn’t either, but by some miracle, he survived. I helped him. After all, witchers on the Path should help each other. The Hunt continued south, and Letho of Gulet knew where it was going. He had two comrades, brother witchers from the School of the Viper. He knew where the hellish chase would end.]  5.15 - CONSPIRACY THEORY: THE BLUE STRIPES < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt emerges from the flashback to see Dandelion.]DANDELION: Hmm... finally awake.GERALT: Where are we?DANDELION: In one of the safest places in the camp, my friend.GERALT: The brothel?DANDELION: Mm-hmm.Why am I here? GERALT: How did I wind up here?DANDELION: I found you out in the fields, unconscious.GERALT: The fog...DANDELION: Gone. Three days ago.GERALT: Three days? You sure?DANDELION: Mhm. In that time, Roche ventured deep into Kaedwen on some secret mission. Managed to go off and come back.What are you doing here? GERALT: Did you come here to fuck?DANDELION: You gotta be kidding. My friend on his deathbed... I couldn\\'t possibly do that.GERALT: Look around – you\\'re in a whorehouse.DANDELION: In a professional capacity only.My memory\\'s coming back. GERALT: Cedric was right. The Power within the battle of specters restores memory.DANDELION: Ah, so did you get a look at another chapter of the epic poem titled \"Geralt of Rivia\"?GERALT: I remember who helped me track down the Wild Hunt.DANDELION: Who?GERALT: Letho... Foltest\\'s murderer... I saved his life, and he knew where to find the Wild Hunt. I don\\'t know if we rescued Yennefer.GERALT: So what happened while I was out?DANDELION: Loads. You drove off the fog of specters, Henselt learned of the plot against him and Dethmold lost it completely.How\\'s Henselt? GERALT: Why has Henselt waited to attack?DANDELION: The Kaedweni nobles and officers are holding out for privileges. They want assurances there\\'ll be no treaty with Nilfgaard, and that they\\'ll get lands in the Pontar Valley...GERALT: Henselt\\'s agreed?DANDELION: Not on your life. He blew up. Roared and wailed and called them cowards. Thing is, he can\\'t alienate the nobles completely. It went on for three days. Finally, he convinced part of the army, probably promised them a thing or two, and moved against Vergen. The battle\\'s probably just getting underway.How has Dethmold lost it? GERALT: What did you mean when you said that Dethmold\\'s lost it?DANDELION: Henselt chewed him out for not telling him about the plot. Then he chewed him out again for failing to find the plotters.GERALT: Dethmold\\'s an ambitious guy. I can see how the stress might\\'ve gotten to him.DANDELION: That \"ambitious guy\" has had every last suspect arrested. Now he\\'s interrogating, torturing and hanging them.GERALT: Yeah, he always goes back to what he does best.Who leads the plotters? GERALT: Any news on who might be behind the plot?DANDELION: They arrested Brightfelt, Kirim of Caingorn and Gunar Blekenhove and his entourage, but I haven\\'t heard any details. Though I do know where to find the leader of the plotters.GERALT: How come?DANDELION: I\\'ve always maintained that brothels are some of the best places under the sun. They\\'re not only great places to...GERALT: Get to the point, Dandelion.DANDELION: I overheard Whistling Wendy talking... Incidentally, don\\'t let her nickname fool you. She\\'s got a beautiful...GERALT: Focus, Dandelion.DANDELION: Haven\\'t the faintest who she was talking to, never saw his face, but I heard him clearly: \"Further instructions from the boss. Today in the hut on the cliff.\"GERALT: Dandelion...[If Geralt hasn\\'t found Dandelion\\'s anti-Henselt pamphlet] GERALT: You\\'ve gotta get out of here. And fast. I\\'ve got a bad feeling. This plot...[If Geralt found Dandelion\\'s pamphlet] GERALT: There\\'s one more thing.DANDELION: Tell me.GERALT: Your pamphlet. If Dethmold finds out...DANDELION: Right. We need to get out of here.GERALT: You need to get out of here. Quick.DANDELION: I\\'m not about to leave you behind, Geralt. Adventure awaits, kingdoms teeter, plenty of things to write up in ballads.GERALT: Dammit, Dandelion. Game\\'s over, can\\'t you see that? When Dethmold finds you... You\\'ve got to go. Somewhere far from the Pontar Valley.DANDELION: All right... I\\'ll do it for you.. I\\'ll go to Oxenfurt, say \"hello\" to some of our old friends.. But just as soon as this blows over, I\\'ll come looking for you.GERALT: I know.DANDELION: We have unfinished business to take care of. What now, Geralt?GERALT: I need to find Síle and the kingslayer. Then I need to get my memory back. First, I\\'m gonna find out who\\'s behind this plot. Though I expect I already know.DANDELION: Think it\\'s Síle?GERALT: Leave, Dandelion. Hide. And I\\'ll see you soon, old friend.[Geralt goes to the house on the cliff.]THELONIUSS: We must rid ourselves of that damned mage, whatever the cost!BORIS: If it were that simple, you\\'d be viceroy by now.YANNICK: Mages don\\'t die easily, and you\\'ve nothing left to offer us.[Inside the hut, three conspirators sit across a table from Roche.]BORIS: Three years ago you promised financial assistance. We were to convey information and resist Dethmold and his supporters in most matters.ROCHE: Nothing\\'s changed...YANNICK: But it has. Foltest and Demavend had their throats slit! Someone, we know not who, wanted to slaughter the Unicorn! The situation is fucking tense and Dethmold\\'s stronger than ever!BORIS: More importantly, you\\'ve nothing to offer us. The Temerian treasury is closed to you.ROCHE: Gentlemen, you forget what will happen if the king learns of our dealings.BORIS: We\\'ll not be intimidated, Roche. And remember - you speak to nobles...ROCHE: I\\'ve been in Kaedwen for three days. Traveled through nearby villages and towns. Saw old friends, sounded out the mood, asked for news outright. The people of Kaedwen detest Dethmold and his thugs. They await the man who would dare to wring his neck...THELONIUSS: Someone approaches. Weapons![Geralt enters the hut.]GERALT: Easy there.BORIS: What the swiving hell is he doing here?!ROCHE: He woke up and walked over, if I\\'m to guess...THELONIUSS: We didn\\'t approve this! How did he know of our meeting?ROCHE: Something I\\'d like to know as well. Geralt?GERALT: I have my ways. Unimportant.ROCHE: But it is. If you know, others might know.GERALT: Overheard a conversation between Whistling Wendy and one of you gentlemen...THELONIUSS: How dare you, freak. I\\'ve a wife!YANNICK: It\\'s shot. It\\'s all shot, Roche. We return to our banners to aid the King in battle. Your plot is done, dissolved, having achieved nothing.BORIS: Gentlemen.[The conspirators get up and leave.]How did you come to lead the plotters? GERALT: How did you ever come to head a conspiracy in a Kaedweni camp?ROCHE: It\\'s a long story. Literally. Foltest and I devised the plan three years ago. Shortly after Henselt burned Sabrina at the stake and appointed Dethmold his adviser. Morale among nobles and officers was low following the failed campaign. We took advantage. I bought them off, gave them political direction... I received information in exchange.GERALT: What was your aim?ROCHE: To sow some ferment, prevent any alliance with the Black Ones and generally limit Dethmold\\'s and Henselt\\'s influence.Any idea what\\'s going on at the camp? GERALT: You were gone three days. Been back at the camp? Any idea what\\'s going on there?ROCHE: I haven\\'t, but continued to get news from those... traitors. Who have they arrested?GERALT: Dandelion mentioned Brightfelt, Kirim of Caingorn and...ROCHE: Not good. Kirim has been one of the plotters since the beginning. He knows me...GERALT: Maybe the interrogators have yet to start on him.ROCHE: Quickly, back to the camp. We need to warn Ves and the others.ROCHE: We\\'ve no time![Geralt and Roche arrive at the Blue Stripes\\' camp and are attacked by two of Dethmold\\'s soldiers.]SOLDIER: Finally, you are here![Geralt and Roche kill the soldiers. A sex worker approaches them.]ROCHE: Where\\'d everyone go?!SEX WORKER: They were invited to a banquet.ROCHE: How do you know?SEX WORKER: I saw Dethmold\\'s messenger arrive.GERALT: What is this feast?SEX WORKER: A celebration. Apparently, Dethmold exposed the leader of some conspiracy...ROCHE: The syphilitic prick...GERALT: Where\\'s this banquet taking place?SEX WORKER: The camp canteen. But it\\'ll be empty now. Everyone\\'s marched on Vergen.ROCHE: Quickly![Inside the gates of the camp, more soldiers greet them. Several new gallows have been erected, and at least a dozen men are swinging from them.]ROCHE: I\\'ll kill the sons of bitches, they\\'ll suffer and die, long and painfully.ROCHE: Cocksucking Kaedwenis. Ploughing forest apes, sons of whores.[Geralt and Roche rush into the canteen, where they find the Blue Stripes hanging from the ceiling.]ROCHE: I\\'ll kill the whoresons... Every last one...[They see Ves sobbing in the corner; she notices Geralt and flings herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck.]GERALT: Ves? Are you all right?VES: Y-yes.ROCHE: What happened?VES: Dethmold invited everyone to a feast. He said the King was grateful that we\\'d helped reveal the plot. A roast pig and two barrels of wine awaited, he said... He said Vernon had just returned from Kaedwen. He was to be personally decorated by the king, and I was to be there to see it... The lads went to the canteen, I went to the royal tent...VES: Well, Roche was not in the King\\'s company. Dethmold jumped around like an ape, shouting that they\\'d all hang as punishment for Flotsam and for conspiring...GERALT: Ves, what did they do to you?VES: I begged them, I pleaded... They laughed at me and let me go...[In Ves\\' memory, she pleads with Henselt.]VES: Your Majesty, withdraw your order, I beg you. They\\'re normal fighting men who were just following orders. They don\\'t deserve to die. Please, Sire, show mercy. They\\'re men of honor, they deserve better.DETHMOLD: Honor? Where was your honor when...HENSELT: Dethmold, leave us.DETHMOLD: Your Grace.HENSELT: What can a whore know of honor? You\\'re a stupid, little strumpet and that is how I shall treat you. You\\'ll behave if you want to see any of your foolish comrades again...[Henselt forces a kiss on Ves. The memory ends.]VES: Don\\'t go there, please... Roche, Dethmold expects you to seek vengeance. He awaits it...ROCHE: He won\\'t need to wait long.VES: Don\\'t you understand?! They hanged the lads to provoke you... you were away, they had a battle to win, they didn\\'t know when you\\'d return... You cannot go there.GERALT: We won\\'t.ROCHE: We\\'ll follow the army, kill every Kaedweni we meet.GERALT: That\\'s suicide.ROCHE: Plough it all. Everything I loved died in this tent. My country disintegrates, my friends cruelly murdered. I want blood...VES: As do I, you\\'ve no idea how much! I can still smell that swine on me. But I\\'ll not let them win! Attack Henselt now, among his army, and blood will flow - but it will only be yours.GERALT: Ves is right, Roche. Let it go for now.ROCHE: Fuck. What do you suggest I do?GERALT: We\\'ll try to get to Vergen through the ravines. I know a hidden path into the town. With the battle raging, we won\\'t be noticed. We\\'ll find Síle and get the kingslayer.ROCHE: And in the process kill as many Kaedwenis as we can.GERALT: Ves, can you manage it?ROCHE: Ves stays. I\\'ll not put her in danger again, and someone must get back to the Percival and its crew. Sail to a nearby cove. We\\'ll need some way to get out of here.VES: I\\'ll take the boat around the bend past the camp and await you there.[She leaves to head to the Percival.]ROCHE: We must head through the ravines.ROCHE: Shit, shit, shit...!GERALT: Ves is lying.ROCHE: What?! I can vouch for her with my life.GERALT: I can\\'t believe she escaped Dethmold.ROCHE: What are you suggesting?GERALT: Nothing...ROCHE: First I\\'ll kill Henselt... then Dethmold. Or maybe the other way round... What do you advise?GERALT: I advise you to shut up and keep your eyes and ears open. Pleasure comes later.  5.16 - THE SIEGE OF VERGEN < PREV CONTENTS[Geralt and Roche head into the ravines, fighting Kaedweni soldiers as they go. Halfway to Vergen, they encounter a troll.]ROCHE: What\\'s that beast?GERALT: A troll. Watch it! He could break your neck with a single blow.ROCHE: Do I look like a cow?TROLL: Who you? What want?Out of my way. GERALT: Out of my way, troll.TROLL: My home this. Run![Geralt and Roche kill the troll.]We\\'re just passing through. GERALT: We\\'re passing through.TROLL: Wishas trolls kill! Me kill! Not easy. Run! Old man coming, old man rip apart you.Calm down, we\\'re going to Vergen. GERALT: Calm down, you silly cow. We\\'re on our way to Vergen.TROLL: Where want run go - this way not. My home is. Folk in and out - no peace for troll. Bother, bother.GERALT: Who does?TROLL: Folk.ROCHE: Geralt, let\\'s end this beast\\'s suffering.You\\'re right. GERALT: Yeah, we don\\'t have time for all this talk.[Geralt and Roche kill the troll.]Maybe she knows something. GERALT: Wait. Who\\'s been bothering you? Try to remember.TROLL: Wisha other. Shine head here come. Fat.GERALT: Did you speak to him?TROLL: Tried. But he my face - whack! Old man called: \"Beatin\\' your missus!\" He sword show. Blood springs. Old man down, wounds. Wisha say rush to Lomin.What\\'s Lomin? GERALT: You mean, Loc Muinne?TROLL: So said. Wisha say rushed, other he\\'d take old man\\'s...ROCHE: You mentioned that already.Anyone else come through? GERALT: Anyone else pass through this way?TROLL: Lady. Came out fog, awful reeked.GERALT: What did she look like?TROLL: Humie lady.ROCHE: Anything more specific?TROLL: Head strange. Horns huge.ROCHE: Síle.TROLL: Say Vergen go. More nuttin\\'.Thanks for the chat. GERALT: Good to chat. No harm in talking, see?TROLL: Oahh... Sleep I. Run out go.GERALT: Sweet dreams.TROLL: Old man see, tell not wake me. I want sleep.[The female troll curls up for a nap against the ravine walls and Geralt and Roche continue. Further on, they encounter another troll fighting several Kaedweni soldiers.]ROCHE: Looks like our new friend\\'s old man is in trouble with the Kaedwenis.TROLL: Thank! Good humies. Bad dead.GERALT: Take care of yourself, troll.TROLL: From gully come. There my missus. Her see?GERALT: We did, yes.TROLL: She how?[If Geralt and Roche killed her] We didn\\'t talk to her. GERALT: She disappeared before we could approach her.TROLL: Dispeared? How? Troll big. Feared, might hid. Help I must. Good old lady, good old bug.She\\'s dead. GERALT: We wanted to leave her alone, just pass through, but she didn\\'t let us explain.TROLL: Kill her you? Me missus?GERALT: We had to defend ourselves.TROLL: Beast! Gut you![Geralt and Roche have to kill him as well.][If Geralt and Roche didn\\'t kill her] She\\'s fine. GERALT: She\\'s all right. But don\\'t wake her or she\\'ll rip your head off.TROLL: Dear old bug! Like me she. Liver fresh feed.She might\\'ve run into those Kaedwenis. GERALT: She\\'s fine as long as she didn\\'t run into a Kaedweni unit.TROLL: Aye, no! Kaedweni no! Kaedweni murer!ROCHE: Maybe she evaded them.TROLL: Old bird\\'s honor I protect! Kill Kaedweni! All kill!GERALT: Go to Vergen. You\\'ll find plenty there.TROLL: I go! Hard hit. Hard![He charges off in the direction of Vergen.][If they sent the troll to Vergen, he attacks the next group of Kaedwenis they encounter in the ravine, allowing Geralt and Roche to slip past unnoticed. Otherwise, they fight through the group themselves. Either way, they enter the Tunnels of the Founders, only to find it occupied.]ROCHE: Looks like Dethmold\\'s people know about the secret passage, too.[After dispatching the two mercenaries, Geralt and Roche open the next door and meet Adam Pangratt and several more of his men.]PANGRATT: Witcher Geralt and Vernon Roche. Now that\\'s some pairing!ROCHE: Out of our way, Pangratt.PANGRATT: Come on, Roche. You know this is no chance meeting.ROCHE: You never appear anywhere by chance. Always turning up where the pay\\'s best.PANGRATT: You haven\\'t changed a bit. Think you\\'re superior because you wiped a royal arse. Sad... Kill them![Pangratt leaves; Geralt and Roche dispatch the mercenaries and continue through the tunnels. At the end, they find Dethmold, along with Pangratt and even more men.]DETHMOLD: You said you\\'d got rid of them.PANGRATT: I underestimated them.ROCHE: You\\'ll pay for my people, you whore\\'s son! For each and every one of them.DETHMOLD: So don\\'t underestimate them this time and never let me down again.[Geralt and Roche defeat Pangratt\\'s mercenaries.]DETHMOLD: Useless brainwaste. The perfect foe for you. Don\\'t chase me, it would be stupid.[Dethmold teleports out of the tunnel. Geralt and Roche approach Pangratt, laying on the ground.]PANGRATT: Hah! That was a good fight... I\\'d forgotten how well you witchers do sword in hand. What now?ROCHE: You murdered my men...PANGRATT: I had nothing to do with it. Wasn\\'t even there. Henselt ordered your men killed, on Dethmold\\'s urging. I\\'ll not ask for your mercy. To tell you the truth, I don\\'t know what I\\'d do in your position. But should you decide to spare me, you have my word I\\'ll go and stay out of your way.Your word\\'s not enough. You need to die. GERALT: Maybe you wouldn\\'t know what to do, but I do. It\\'d be stupid to leave an enemy alive behind our backs.PANGRATT: I\\'ll not beg you. Finish this.[Geralt kills Pangratt.]I\\'ll hold you to that. Go where you will. GERALT: I\\'ll hold you to your word. Go where you will.ROCHE: Next time, choose your missions more carefully.PANGRATT: Perhaps it\\'s time to rest. Got a woman in Tretogor - Julia. She\\'s expecting...ROCHE: You knocked up Pretty Kitty? Ah, congratulations, Pangratt. And give her my regards.PANGRATT: Thanks, witcher. I won\\'t be needing this anymore. Take it.[He gives Geralt his sword the Nevde Seidhe.]PANGRATT: Farewell to you both.ROCHE: See you the next time a war rolls around.[Geralt and Roche exit the tunnels into the thick of a battle. Zoltan runs at them, yelling.]ZOLTAN: Hex on you, bastard...! Geralt?ZOLTAN: I thought it was Henselt\\'s mob that got through the tunnels.GERALT: They tried.ZOLTAN: Glad you knocked it out of their heads. So good to see you! Where\\'s Dandelion?GERALT: Headed west. To Oxenfurt.ZOLTAN: Who\\'d he ploughin\\' cross this time?GERALT: Henselt.ZOLTAN: Hah! Henselt\\'s about to get whooped, bare-arsed and all. Dandelion could\\'ve stayed.GERALT: Zoltan, Vergen will fall. Get out of here while you can.ZOLTAN: Oi, there\\'d be nothin\\' dwarven about that. Leaving my mates?GERALT: All right. Just don\\'t get killed.ZOLTAN: Don\\'t get killed yerself, you divot. As soon as Vergen\\'s victorious, I\\'ll find Dandelion. I owe him that much. Incidentally, what\\'re you doin\\' here?We\\'re looking for Henselt. GERALT: We\\'ve got some unfinished business with Henselt.ZOLTAN: We all have unfinished business with that nitwit.GERALT: Is he leading the army himself?ZOLTAN: He wouldn\\'t have it any other way...We\\'re tracking Síle. GERALT: We\\'re looking for Síle de Tansarville. We heard she was in Vergen.ZOLTAN: I caught a flash of her noble arse, but only briefly. She\\'s staying in the house of that other sorceress, what\\'s her name...GERALT: Philippa Eilhart.ZOLTAN: That\\'s the one. Maybe they\\'re screwing, \\'cos I heard that Philippa...GERALT: Where\\'s the house?ZOLTAN: It\\'s the furthest to the north. Shortest way is across the rope bridge.GERALT: Mhm.ZOLTAN: And listen. She has a secret passage extending beyond the city walls.GERALT: Thanks.ZOLTAN: One more thing... They\\'ve surrounded Iorveth! He\\'s holed up in the town hall with a handful of Squirrels. Help him...[Geralt and Roche run into a tower and up several flights of stairs to the bridge entrance.]ROCHE: There\\'s the bridge! Let\\'s go![Roche runs out onto the bridge and falls through the middle of it, rolling and coming up in the middle of the fighting.]ROCHE: Fuck!GERALT: Still alive?ROCHE: Go around! We\\'ll meet at Philippa\\'s house![Geralt heads to the town hall where Iorveth and his men are trapped, and assists the Squirrels.][If Geralt helped Iorveth at Cáelmewedd] IORVETH: I didn\\'t expect to see you here, dh\\'oine.GERALT: A surprise visit. I hope we meet in better circumstances next time.IORVETH: There will be no next time. There is no more Saskia, no Upper Aedirn... It\\'s all gone.GERALT: Upper Aedirn will endure.IORVETH: It will never be the way we\\'d hoped. Goodbye, Witcher.[If Geralt helped Roche at Cáelmewedd] IORVETH: I\\'d be less surprised to find you among Henselt\\'s mercenaries.GERALT: You never did get me, Iorveth.IORVETH: I haven\\'t forgotten about Flotsam. We shan\\'t retreat into the woods just because Upper Aedirn has been conquered.GERALT: Your dream\\'s over, Iorveth.IORVETH: Never...[Geralt heads to Philippa\\'s house, encountering a golem on his way. He enters the house just in time to Síle vanish into a portal.]GERALT: I\\'ll see you in Loc Muinne.[Henselt and his men enter.]GERALT: You\\'re late, King.HENSELT: Where are they?GERALT: No idea.HENSELT: Tell me or I\\'ll...GERALT: Don\\'t make me laugh. You wouldn\\'t let me out of here alive anyway.HENSELT: A soothsayer, now! Kill him![Geralt kills Henselt\\'s men and defeats the king.]HENSELT: Er... You can certainly fence. It seems I\\'ve met my match. You\\'ve won the battle, but lost the war. The city\\'s in my hands.[Roche enters the room and bars the door.]ROCHE: And you\\'re in mine.[Character animatic plays.\\xa0GERALT, NARRATING: For the good of the Temerian crown, Vernon Roche is prepared to do anything. If needed, he becomes a murderer and requires others to do the same. Bernard Loredo had only disdain for the world, gave it nothing but suffering...

Even if both are murderers and rapists...]HENSELT: Vernon Roche – Temerian cockerel of the Blue Stripes? What will you do with me?ROCHE: You know perfectly well.HENSELT: You won\\'t kill me. You wouldn\\'t dare. I\\'m the King of Kaedwen and soon of Lormark. The North won\\'t survive without me. I\\'ve won! Do you know why I rushed into battle? Do you? I had to resolve it before Loc Muinne...ROCHE: He\\'s playing for time... Let\\'s kill him.GERALT: Wait. Tell us, King.

He who controls the Pontar Valley controls the North.GERALT: Have the mages been invited?HENSELT: It\\'s their idea. They want to revive the Council and Conclave.

I\\'ll show them who\\'s ruler!ROCHE: You had my men killed...HENSELT: Of course I had them killed.

The fact that I\\'ve made Kaedwen stronger than ever? You fool! I\\'m the last ruler of the North, whom Nilfgaard must respect. And it will!HENSELT: Witcher, reason with him.You raped Ves. GERALT: Are murder and rape royal virtues of the new order, too?HENSELT: Every wench dreams of being ploughed by a king.ROCHE: And Ves?HENSELT: Did she complain to you? I thought she liked it. She squeaked like an un-oiled hinge...Let\\'s go, Roche. GERALT: Let\\'s get out of here, Vernon.ROCHE: Have you lost your mind?GERALT: You wanted to kill a king, not a cockroach.ROCHE: I won\\'t forgive him.GERALT: Want to be like those murderers you chase, because of this son of a bitch? Kill Henselt and you\\'ll aid the kingslayers\\' agenda. Let\\'s go.ROCHE: Why should we spare him?

You proved it.ROCHE: Not when I needed them most.GERALT: You had a choice: kill the defenseless Henselt or battle yourself. You chose the tougher opponent and won.ROCHE: I may regret that to the end of my days.He\\'s yours, Roche. [If Geralt didn\\'t ask about Ves] GERALT: He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword. I\\'m leaving you two alone.ROCHE: Scared?HENSELT: No...HENSELT: Witcher... Surely you didn\\'t lift the curse from me to now have me murdered?GERALT: You don\\'t know a thing about curses. Make it quick.[If Geralt asked about Ves] GERALT: I\\'m leaving you two alone.ROCHE: Squeaky hinge... Funny, very funny.HENSELT: You wouldn\\'t dare...ROCHE: Enough of this ploughing chatter. Someone needs to die, and I\\'ll sleep better for it.HENSELT: I am Henselt of Ard Carraigh, the last of the Unicorns. I won\\'t beg for mercy.ROCHE: Look me in the eyes.HENSELT: Go on, take your revenge.[Roche stabs Henselt in the gut.]HENSELT: Uhhuhhg! A flea... has bitten a lion.[Roche leaves the building, and Geralt falls into step next to him.]GERALT: Henselt...?[Roche shakes his head.]GERALT: Only we know what happened here... Well, and Henselt. The sooner we forget it the better.ROCHE: I\\'ll erase it from my memory.GERALT: Síle teleported herself to Loc Muinne.ROCHE: Where there\\'s Síle, there\\'s Letho. The murderers are gathering for their peace talks.GERALT: We have to be there.[DANDELION, NARRATING: Síle de Tansarville! I\\'d sensed from the start that some dark mystery lay behind that cold countenance...\\xa0Following the demise of the Council and Conclave, there was no one left to keep the mages in line, but regicide? Why? What was this all about? It seemed these questions would be answered at Loc Muinne... an ancient city amidst mountains, the remnants of the civilization of the Vrans, whose dusk had come long ago.\\xa0And you would be right to ask, \"Why did you not set out for Loc Muinne, Master Dandelion?\" Your humble servant and chronicler was forced to flee the Pontar Valley as he very well might have paid with his life for his heroic stand against King Henselt. And to allow oneself to be humbly slaughtered, consigning to oblivion this account of incredible events, would be a grave transgression against the arts and letters.\\xa0Yet forever feeling a vast, shared responsbiilty for the fate of the North, I dispatched to Loc Muinne my faithful and capable friend, Geralt of Rivia. Have I mentioned his disdain for politics? Well, it was at Loc Muinne where he could finally give vent to it.][Continued in Chapter III (Roche).]Back to topDocument © Laurelnose.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://laurelnose.github.io/chapter-3-roche/'}, page_content=' [TITLE TEXT: Loc Muinne in the Blue Mountains, one week later] [The camera pans over Loc Muinne\\'s courtyard from above. The commander of Dethmold\\'s soldiers is in the courtyard is eating an apple. Dethmold arrives and takes his apple, biting into it himself.]DETHMOLD: Has Radovid\\'s messenger been by?COMMANDER: Yes, sir.DETHMOLD: And what did he say?COMMANDER: Temeria cannot survive... the kingdom will be divided - the nobles are riled, Constable Natalis stands on shaky ground.DETHMOLD: Loyal old Natalis will get kicked in the arse. How predictable.COMMANDER: They nearly reached an agreement, but without Foltest\\'s daughter it didn\\'t work out.DETHMOLD: Perfect. Are the quarters ready?COMMANDER: There is a... little problem.DETHMOLD: Then we must look at this problem. [Dethmold and the soldier arrive at the cell where Anaïs is being kept; it is an open room with one guard standing in front.]DETHMOLD: There\\'s no door.COMMANDER: We can\\'t lock her in a doorless cell.DETHMOLD: I can see that, you fool. Out of my way.DETHMOLD: Uncle Dethmold will cast a tiny spell on your little house.DETHMOLD: Ver\\'sah anemo! [Dethmold casts a spell, and a web of blue lines crosses the open door.][If Aryan La Valette is alive]DETHMOLD: We won\\'t let that naughty Natalis get you.[If Aryan La Valette is dead]DETHMOLD: Nilfgaard\\'s most precious gift. [The guard accidentally gets shocked by the blue lines. Anaïs is visible behind them, head lowered. Dethmold and his commander leave.]DETHMOLD: Clear up in here. This is Loc Muinne, not a bloody pigsty![Camera cuts to Roche and Geralt talking in the mountains on the way to Loc Muinne.]ROCHE: Oh, bollocks, Geralt. Marshal Raupenneck was a cruel, bloodthirsty prick, true - but the times were different.GERALT: He had his men murder every last elf in Loc Muinne...ROCHE: For years, Iorveth and his ilk have been using that banner to wipe their arses clean of the shit they do. In wartime, a commander\\'s forced to make all kinds of decisions - it\\'s as simple as that.GERALT: Yeah, and I\\'m sure it lay really heavily on Raupenneck\\'s conscience.ROCHE: Bollocks, again. I\\'ve already admitted he was a prick. Are you defending the Aen Seidhe? They\\'ve got barrels of blood on their hands as well.ROCHE: \"With the Vrans gone, we had to safeguard this source of the Power, safeguard this historic city.\" Hah, elven drivel. Heaps of lizard-like bones were found in nearby caves - all bearing traces of sword cuts. Ah, think what you will, I\\'m more interested in the city\\'s current inhabitants.GERALT: Why am I worried you\\'re going to do something really stupid once we get there?ROCHE: Above all, I\\'ll find the cure to my suffering. [If Henselt is dead]GERALT: Dethmold was just a pawn in Henselt\\'s hands.ROCHE: Dethmold is a bloody murderer and Henselt was a king. A king I killed.ROCHE: He didn\\'t believe I\\'d do it till the very end. Nor did I. It\\'s not something I want to discuss again. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever strike those images from my mind, but I know I don\\'t want to talk about it.GERALT: Taking revenge on Dethmold won\\'t change a thing.ROCHE: Ah, but it will. The ghosts of my comrades will drink to my health. [If Henselt is alive]ROCHE: Its name is Dethmold.GERALT: Careful you don\\'t step in some serious shit while looking for that cure.ROCHE: He will feel death consuming him.GERALT: You\\'re counting wyverns before they\\'ve hatched...ROCHE: Huh. He\\'s no wyvern. He\\'s a rat with no sewer left to hide in.ROCHE: The Blue Stripes were more than a fighting force. I selected and trained those men myself. True, there were good days and bad... But they weren\\'t even given the chance to die in combat.GERALT: You also lost your king, Vernon. Don\\'t forget why you embarked on this mission.ROCHE: I haven\\'t. If Letho and Síle are in Loc Muinne... they\\'ll never leave it alive.[Geralt and Roche make their way down the winding mountain path to Loc Muinne\\'s gates, fighting harpies as they go. At the base of the mountain, they see two guards stationed.]ROCHE: Knights of the Order...GERALT: This is the last place I\\'d expect to see Knights of the Flaming Rose.ROCHE: They\\'re here with Radovid. After losing their foothold in Temeria, they rebuilt their position at the Redanian court. You\\'d best stay out of sight. You never know with those bigots. [If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Siegfried is dead]GERALT: Yeah, we also had a little disagreement recently. They could be holding a grudge.ROCHE: I\\'ll explain that your presence in Loc Muinne is necessary. [If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Siegfried alive]GERALT: Don\\'t worry about the knights. Not so long ago I saved their asses. They oughta remember that much.ROCHE: That was before you were accused of regicide. This is no man\\'s land, Geralt. Anything can happen here. I\\'ll vouch for you where I can, but that\\'ll only get you so far.GERALT: What now? What can we expect to see in the city?ROCHE: Separate camps, buffer zones and frequent patrols. Or that\\'s how it should be organized if those mages from the Conclave have any sense.GERALT: Ah, another area of your expertise.ROCHE: The Peace of Cintra was signed on April 2nd, and all around was quiet, calm and orderly - if you don\\'t count Henselt\\'s roars and the all-night festivities of the Mahakam Volunteer Army.ROCHE: And the common folk were positively thrilled with the parade that followed. Yet not one of those fuckers even knew that I, and a few others like me, spent a week poring over the city map and devising a way to keep those crowned idiots separate. Just in case one decided to deal the next blow in a long-standing feud.ROCHE: Uh, in any case, I hope to see something similar here.GERALT: Relax, the mages want royal gold. They\\'ll make sure all the sources of financing remain alive and present, at least until the inevitable quarrel over the Pontar Valley breaks out.ROCHE: Well, we\\'ll see if there\\'s indeed a way where there\\'s a will. If we\\'re separated, we\\'ll meet up again in the main square.GERALT: Fine. [Geralt and Roche approach the knights guarding the path into Loc Muinne.]ORDER KNIGHT: Halt! Who goes there?ROCHE: Vernon Roche and Geralt of Rivia. In the service of Temeria.ORDER KNIGHT: Foltest\\'s killer in the service of Temeria?ROCHE: Foltest\\'s killer is in Loc Muinne. Geralt of Rivia will help me capture him. [If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Siegfried is dead]ORDER KNIGHT: I couldn\\'t give a pig\\'s arse who killed Foltest, but this bastard raised his hand against the Order, and I\\'ll not let him pass.GERALT: In that case, I\\'ll walk in over your dead body, brother.ROCHE: Bear in mind that peace negotiations are underway behind those walls. I\\'ll have no blood spilt here. [If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Siegfried alive]GERALT: Since you\\'re Knights of the Order, is there a ponce named Siegfried among you?ORDER KNIGHT: There is, indeed.GERALT: Tell him I\\'m here. He\\'s sure to be pleased to see me.ORDER KNIGHT: And why is that?GERALT: Well, he wouldn\\'t be Grand Master if it wasn\\'t for me.ORDER KNIGHT: Come through, then.ROCHE: Why are the Knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose here?ORDER KNIGHT: We\\'re here on the invitation of His Majesty King Radovid.GERALT: Radovid can invite anyone he wants to Redania. Problem is, this isn\\'t Redania.ORDER KNIGHT: Questioning the King\\'s will?ROCHE: If Radovid invited you here, why are you encamped outside the city?ORDER KNIGHT: We\\'re not part of the official delegation...ROCHE: Well, we\\'re on our way to an official audience with King Radovid. He\\'s expecting us, so stand aside. [Geralt and Roche pass and make their way through the Order of the Flaming Rose camp.]GERALT: Looks like Radovid doesn\\'t believe the peace talks will end peacefully.ROCHE: You can be sure of one thing - not a soul is to be trusted in this city.GERALT: Not a soul to be trusted anytime, anywhere - period.ROCHE: We need to assess the situation. Whoever stationed the knights at Loc Muinne\\'s gates is likely to know the most, and to have the upper hand.ROCHE: I\\'m going to the Redanian camp. If you want to look around, I\\'ll meet you near Radovid\\'s headquarters.GERALT: All right. [On his way to meet Roche, Geralt runs into a Nilfgaardian mage accompanied by several soldiers.]MAGE: I don\\'t believe you killed Foltest.GERALT: I didn\\'t.MAGE: But a bounty is a bounty. I\\'m sure you understand, as a professional. It\\'s nothing personal.GERALT: *Sigh* One more windbag. [Geralt defeats the bounty hunters and goes to meet Roche in the town square.]ROCHE: Ready for your chat with Radovid? I need to do something first.GERALT: I need to look around Loc Muinne some more.ROCHE: All right, but don\\'t take too long. Our matters can\\'t wait forever. Yeah, let\\'s go.GERALT: No reason to delay it.ROCHE: Follow me, then. [Geralt and Roche are halted by a pair of guards on their way into the Redanian encampment.]ORDER KNIGHT: Halt!ROCHE: We\\'re here to meet King Radovid.ORDER KNIGHT: Have you been granted an official audience?We have important news. GERALT: No, but we have some very important news for him.ORDER KNIGHT: I cannot let you through to see the King.[Continues with the same Witcher 1 import lines as below.]We have information about the recent slayings of monarchs. GERALT: We have information about the kingslayers.ORDER KNIGHT: Everyone knows the killer is the witcher from Rivia.GERALT: Then everyone is wrong.ORDER KNIGHT: Not my concern. I cannot risk placing the King of Redania in harm\\'s way. [If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Siegfried is dead]GERALT: We bring Radovid news that will strengthen his position during the talks. Care to risk his wrath? [If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Siegfried alive]GERALT: The Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose will vouch for us.GERALT: Besides, this camp is swarming with soldiers. We\\'d have to be stupid or suicidal to attack Radovid.ORDER KNIGHT: Hm, pass then, if your news is so important. But one word from the King and you\\'ll hang - both of you.ROCHE: Don\\'t you worry about us.[Geralt and Roche pass through the Redanian encampment.]ROCHE: Temeria stands little chance of surviving if Radovid has made terms with Kaedwen.GERALT: Even less if he\\'s made a pact with Nilfgaard. He and the Emperor could divide the entire North between them.ROCHE: I\\'d take pleasure in seeing Kaedwen picked apart.GERALT: But they\\'d start with the country deepest in chaos. So you\\'d best hope nothing of that sort has happened.[Two guards bar their way to Radovid\\'s meeting hall with their halberds.]ORDER KNIGHT: Did you request an audience with the King?GERALT: Yes.ORDER KNIGHT: The King will receive you.[Geralt and Roche approach Radovid, who is meeting with several nobles. When he sees them, Radovid dismisses the nobles.]RADOVID: Geralt of Rivia.GERALT: Your Majesty.RADOVID: As usual, you turn up where and when you\\'re least expected. And in such company. I never thought they\\'d make a soldier out of you.I had no choice under the circumstances. GERALT: It\\'s hard to focus on killing monsters when so many people are out to kill me.I\\'m no soldier. GERALT: Associating with military men doesn\\'t make one a mercenary, Your Grace. I\\'m no soldier. I\\'m here to settle some scores.Roche is a friend. GERALT: Vernon Roche is a friend. He\\'s in uniform, sure, but that\\'s meaningless.RADOVID: The world has changed greatly since we met those few months ago. Temeria stands at the brink of civil war, Kaedwen has taken the Pontar Valley by force, and a Nilfgaardian delegation plays a prominent role at a summit of the Northern Kingdoms.[If Henselt is dead] RADOVID: Foltest and Demavend are both dead, though it seems we were signing treaties just yesterday...Henselt was butchered in Vergen.[If Henselt is alive] RADOVID: Foltest and Demavend are both dead, though it seems we were signing treaties just yesterday...What are the Nilfgaardians doing here? GERALT: What\\'s the delegation from Nilfgaard doing here?RADOVID: Henselt invited them.[If Henselt is dead] RADOVID: Before he died.RADOVID: Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen would never miss an opportunity like this one. He\\'ll come to the talks and stage his favorite drama.Why have you brought the knights of the Order here? GERALT: Why did you bring the Knights of the Order here, Your Majesty?RADOVID: The Order of the Flaming Rose is here to ensure that the talks remain peaceful. We wish to avoid a second Thanedd.I need your assistance, Sire. GERALT: I\\'ve come here for help, Your Majesty.RADOVID: Wait, witcher. Were it not for you, Henselt would have perished at the hands of an assassin. Am I right?News travels fast... GERALT: My reputation precedes me yet again...RADOVID: From soldier to soldier, from whores to barons... right up to the royal ears.What\\'s Henselt got to do with it? GERALT: Why do you ask about him, Your Majesty?RADOVID: Mere curiosity, but I understand if you\\'d rather not talk about it.Henselt is dead. GERALT: I only delayed his death.That\\'s true. GERALT: I killed a would-be assassin. Pure coincidence - I just happened to be there.RADOVID: Things like that oft seem to happen to you...[If Henselt is alive] [Continues from \"RADOVID: You said you needed help, witcher.\"][If Henselt is dead] RADOVID: Do you know how he died?[PERSUASION] I wasn\\'t there. GERALT: I wasn\\'t there.[FAILURE] RADOVID: The first lie of the day and the negotiations have yet to begin. How can I help you if you\\'re not honest with me?[Gives same options to continue as \"Yes.\"][SUCCESS] RADOVID: Well then - he perished during the battle for Vergen. Apparently once the city had been taken, Dethmold claims. Even he could not save his King. To think - a pack of peasants fighting to the death for a lost cause. The Knighthood is in grave danger.RADOVID: Enough about Henselt.Yes. GERALT: Yes, I was there.RADOVID: Speak then.It was Roche\\'s revenge. GERALT: Henselt had Roche\\'s unit murdered - I can\\'t call it anything else. In doing that, he signed his own death sentence. In the chaos that followed the battle of Vergen, we caught up to him in one of the houses.ROCHE: I killed him because it had to be done. It was just. And Dethmold is next on the list.RADOVID: That is the only reason I won\\'t have you hanged, Vernon Roche.[PERSUASION] I killed him. GERALT: I killed him.GERALT: When he was looking for Saskia in Vergen, after the battle, I cornered him in a hut and I killed him.[FAILURE] RADOVID: It all sounds very noble, witcher. But a noble lie is a lie nevertheless. I think I know what happened there.RADOVID: Yet even though at least one of you is a kingslayer, I can possibly use you both.[SUCCESS]\\xa0RADOVID: What about Dethmold?GERALT: He followed orders and deserves the same.RADOVID: Maybe we can come to some sort of arrangement.RADOVID: You said you needed help, witcher. Tell me more.Who\\'s representing Temeria? GERALT: If Temeria is in turmoil, then who has arrived to represent it?RADOVID: Constable Natalis, the hero of Brenna, which is good. His presence is like a slap on Shilard\\'s face delivered by the North.Are the Kaedwenis here? [If Henselt is dead] GERALT: Who\\'s representing Kaedwen?RADOVID: Only the sorcerer Dethmold and his men are in Loc Muinne. But Dethmold represents himself.[If Henselt is alive] GERALT: Has King Henselt arrived?RADOVID: Pfff... He\\'s been talking about his great victory at Vergen ever since.Síle de Tansarville commissioned the regicides. GERALT: Síle de Tansarville is behind the murderers that hit Temeria, Aedirn and Kaedwen.RADOVID: How do you know?[PERSUASION] You have to trust me, Sire. [This automatically fails if Geralt has already failed to lie to Radovid.]GERALT: I don\\'t have any proof, but it\\'s her. You\\'ve got to believe me, Your Majesty.[FAILURE] RADOVID: A witcher\\'s word is not quite enough.[SUCCESS] RADOVID: Let\\'s say I believe you.I found out from the dying killer. GERALT: I found one of the assassins after Henselt\\'s murder. Before he died, he revealed De Tansarville\\'s role to me.RADOVID: Why you in particular?[PERSUASION] A dying man\\'s desperation... GERALT: The desperation of a dying man.[FAILURE] RADOVID: A kingslayer offering a confession? I doubt it.[SUCCESS] RADOVID: If you say so.[AXII] I don\\'t know. GERALT: No idea.[FAILURE] RADOVID: Somehow, I\\'m convinced that you know.[SUCCESS] RADOVID: It\\'s no longer important.He remembered me from the past. GERALT: He knew me from the time I can\\'t remember.RADOVID: Your past troubles me, Geralt. But I have more pressing matters today.I know thanks to Dethmold\\'s magic. GERALT: We killed one of them in Aedirn. Dethmold used his magic to give me a glimpse of the past. I saw the assassin talking to others. They spoke of Síle.RADOVID: One mage\\'s magic shows another\\'s guilt. And it\\'s no ordinary magic, but the forbidden path of necromancy.RADOVID: It all makes sense. Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen warned me about a plot. Apparently, Triss Merigold confessed to him that the sorceresses had set up a secret Lodge.GERALT: Triss is working with Shilard?RADOVID: She\\'s been detained as a suspect. Shilard believes the sorceresses of Nilfgaard were also part of the conspiracy. Luckily, the entire amphitheatre is under a spell that quells any magic. Otherwise, no one would dare go near all those mages.RADOVID: Well, the talks beckon. Everyone wants to see Temeria\\'s bitter end.ROCHE: What do you mean by that, Your Majesty?RADOVID: The nobles are rebelling in Vizima. Lacking a ruler, they simply want to divide the kingdom into provinces.[If Henselt is dead] ROCHE: Divide Temeria? Shame on the traitors!RADOVID: Well... it doesn\\'t have to be that way.[If Henselt is alive] RADOVID: Temeria separates the North from Nilfgaard. In the hands of local barons and warlords, it will be nothing more than a means for the Nilfgaardian cavalry to gain momentum. Henselt wants Redania and Kaedwen to partition it.ROCHE: For shame!RADOVID: I have no choice. Unless we help each other, witcher.RADOVID: Anaïs, the daughter of Louisa and Foltest, lives still.[If Aryan La Valette is dead] RADOVID: After the baroness\\'s rebellion, the girl was captured by the Nilfgaardians. The child has become a bargaining chip between the Empire and Kaedwen.What about Síle? GERALT: What about Síle?RADOVID: Easy, witcher. I have ways to deal with impertinent sorceresses. I have managed to tame Philippa Eilhart. Why shouldn\\'t I do so with Síle de Tansarville as well?Why is Dethmold holding Anaïs? GERALT: Why does Dethmold need Foltest\\'s daughter?[If Henselt is dead]RADOVID: The girl has become entirely dependent on him, which will strengthen his position in the Conclave. Remember, he who has Anaïs will have the upper hand today.[If Henselt is alive]RADOVID: Henselt is pressuring me on the subject of partition. He firmly believes he\\'s pulling all the strings.[Continues from \"RADOVID: The girl is most important.\"][If Aryan La Valette is alive] RADOVID: After Foltest\\'s death, the La Valettes came to prominence. Louisa\\'s uncle, Baron Orvall, became one of the most important people in Temeria. He wanted to see Anaïs on the throne... but Vizima was still in turmoil. They sent her to Loc Muinne anyway to declare her queen before the entire North.RADOVID: During the journey the girl was kidnapped. Aryan La Valette asked me to use my connections to find his sister, which I did. My people tell me Anaïs is here in Loc Muinne, in Dethmold\\'s hands.RADOVID: I cannot mount an armed attack on the Kaedwenis. It would be tantamount to declaring war, and we have gathered here to maintain peace. A lone witcher and a former soldier - that would be a different matter...RADOVID: Bring me Anaïs, Geralt, and I\\'ll salvage a united Temeria and punish those whose hands are stained with the Temerian king\\'s blood.What about Síle? [Same as above.]Is Aryan alive? GERALT: I heard Aryan died in the fire that consumed La Valette Castle.RADOVID: We all thought so. And we were all wrong.RADOVID: The girl is most important, witcher.[If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Adda is dead] RADOVID: I\\'d announce our engagement and make her Queen of Redania and Temeria. The nobles of Vizima would greet her on bended knee, and the North would emerge stronger than ever.[If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Adda alive] RADOVID: I would look after her, take her back to Tretogor in Redania, where she would mature under the caring gaze of her half-sister and my wife, Adda.RADOVID: When she\\'s of age, she can claim the throne and thus guarantee Temeria\\'s sovereignty.RADOVID: I must attend these talks, Geralt. Time is short. Bring me the girl. The two of you - men without country or commander, renegades that no one seems to have taken into account.RADOVID: I, in turn, promise that Síle de Tansarville will pay for her deeds. I shall punish her with fire and steel.ROCHE: An alliance with Redania is our only chance at preserving Temeria\\'s independence.GERALT: It\\'s still risky.ROCHE: Anaïs - she\\'s the key.GERALT: I still wonder about Boussy\\'s death. The boy would have had a stronger claim to the throne.ROCHE: Maybe Anaïs can tell us something. It\\'s high time we visited our old friend Dethmold.GERALT: The Emperor\\'s men hold Triss. They\\'ll get everything they can out of her... after which she\\'ll be dispensable.ROCHE: If it\\'s between the sorceress\\'s life and Temeria\\'s future, then I\\'ve no choice. I\\'m sorry. This is no place to talk. Let\\'s wait till we\\'re beyond the gate.[Geralt and Roche emerge from the Redanian quarters. In the town square, a woman being followed by two men looks over her shoulder frantically. She sees Roche and runs up to him; her pursuers look uncertain and leave.]BRIGIDA: Roche?BRIGIDA: ROCHE![Roche turns.]ROCHE: Just the person I\\'d be looking for were I not forced to seek Anaïs La Valette. You have much to explain, Brigida Papebrock.BRIGIDA: Oh, no. You\\'ll not pin this on me! I trusted you and you sent me into a den of vipers! Vipers!GERALT: Another Ves?ROCHE: This is no time for pleasantries, Geralt. Calm yourself, Brigida. You were to watch Foltest\\'s children. I saw nothing dangerous in the task. Obviously, I was wrong. But I need your help. Anaïs has been kidnapped, Boussy is likely dead - I need to know how this happened. I need to know the details.BRIGIDA: You knew well what you were getting me into. You know that entire rotting bunch - the count, the baron!ROCHE: Not half as well as you do, my dear... Who were those men?BRIGIDA: Not so fast, Roche. I have been hiding in this city for three days, scurrying about like a rat. They\\'re hunting me. I\\'ll not let you leave me here.GERALT: What do you propose?BRIGIDA: Escort me out of the city, to the river.GERALT: What will that get you?BRIGIDA: I expected I would need to fend for myself. I\\'ve secured passage. Take me there, and I will tell you all.ROCHE: It\\'s a long way...BRIGIDA: You\\'ve a traitor in your camp, Roche. Perhaps more than one. What happened to Foltest\\'s bastards is no series of coincidences. It\\'s the result of a clever, treacherous game.ROCHE: Damn it all... Geralt, I need to look to Anaïs, learn how we\\'re to get to her. But Brigida might know what happened to Boussy. Thus far we\\'ve heard nothing but rumors. Take her to the river.Fine. GERALT: All right, Roche. I\\'ll help you this one last time.ROCHE: I\\'ll search for a back way into the Kaedweni camp.GERALT: You\\'re forgetting - I came here for Triss.ROCHE: Whatever you decide to do later, so be it. But a traitor in the Temerian camp threatens us all. Escort Brigida, learn what you can.BRIGIDA: I\\'d thank you, Roche, if you weren\\'t such a shit.ROCHE: I\\'m counting on you, Geralt. Brigida must get to her destination safely.GERALT: Good luck, Roche.We have more important matters. GERALT: I came here for Triss. These are your matters and your people, Roche. Keep me out of this.ROCHE: Forgive me, Brigida. You must fend for yourself.BRIGIDA: You\\'re a true scoundrel. And an idiot. I shall wait by the main gate. You have one hour. Then I\\'m gone - as is my evidence and all I know.GERALT: Hm. That comes pretty easily to you, doesn\\'t it.ROCHE: What\\'s that?GERALT: Letting people go.ROCHE: Bollocks, Geralt. Compare her situation to Anaïs\\'. Who\\'s in greater need? Besides, I wouldn’t have let her go if I didn\\'t believe she could manage. Brigida Papebrock is fully capable of taking care of her own arse.GERALT: What if she knows something important?ROCHE: Then she\\'ll deliver that knowledge where she needs to. There\\'ll be time for that later. Geralt, I\\'ll try to find a back way into the Kaedweni camp - it won\\'t be easy...GERALT: I\\'d say the same for the Nilfgaardian camp.ROCHE: You need to decide. If you choose what\\'s personally important... well, I won\\'t agree, but I\\'ll respect it.Dethmold is your personal business. GERALT: And dropping in on Dethmold is not a personal matter to you?ROCHE: It\\'s the icing on the cake. Temeria\\'s future - that\\'s what really matters.I\\'m talking about the kingslayer. GERALT: Explaining who\\'s behind the regicides is not just my business. And the Nilfgaardian camp is where I think we\\'ll learn the truth.ROCHE: The regicides are part of the past. Temeria\\'s future is what counts. And you have to decide what\\'s more important to you.ROCHE: I\\'ll go investigate the Kaedweni camp - look for a way in. Find me there when you make up your mind, but don\\'t take long.GERALT: All right.  7.2 - CROWN WITNESS < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt meets Brigida at the gate.]BRIGIDA: I\\'ll not stay one minute longer in this cursed city. Are you ready?I need to tend to something first. GERALT: Wait for me here. I\\'ll be back soon.BRIGIDA: Don\\'t dawdle, witcher. I\\'m not wanted in Loc Muinne - that\\'s painfully clear.Yeah. GERALT: Yeah, let\\'s go.GERALT: Which way are we headed?BRIGIDA: We shall leave Loc Muinne through the Order\\'s camp - we won\\'t be bothered there. Then we\\'ll descend the mountain path and go on to the river. Who knows what we\\'ll find...GERALT: Expecting someone?BRIGIDA: Does it matter, witcher...?GERALT: You did mention vipers. A count and a baron?BRIGIDA: Maravel and Kimbolt. Powerful men, important in the Temerian camp, and thoroughly unscrupulous...GERALT: Vernon\\'s mentioned them. I guess I have them to thank for an interesting chat Roche and I had a while back. Know them well?BRIGIDA: Too early to pry, witcher. I\\'ll not let you pick my brain and abandon me.[Geralt and Brigida exit the camp of the Order of the Flaming Rose.]GERALT: The main path leads to the right.BRIGIDA: That\\'s where they\\'re likely to be waiting.GERALT: Roche would say they\\'d be waiting along both paths.BRIGIDA: Roche, Roche, Roche... You\\'re with me, not him. And I decide for myself. I\\'ve agreed to meet someone on the riverbank. We\\'ll go through the wood.BRIGIDA: Calm thus far. Your dear Roche seems to have been wrong.GERALT: You two have a history, or do I have it wrong?BRIGIDA: He asked a favor of me. I was to stay with Foltest\\'s children, watch them, travel with them, if necessary. Child\\'s play, the bastard called it. That\\'s how I wound up in the caravan transporting the children to Loc Muinne for the summit.GERALT: Hm. Yeah, that clearly went sour. Tell me more.BRIGIDA: Soon enough. We\\'ve just got to make it through the forest. It\\'s a short way to the river beyond that. It should be calm.GERALT: Let\\'s go.BRIGIDA: It\\'s not far now. Redlen awaits down by the river, at the end of this path.GERALT: Is Redlen another of Roche\\'s contacts?BRIGIDA: No, a smuggler. I\\'d be looking for another way out if he were Roche\\'s man.GERALT: Stay behind me.[Geralt and Brigida come to a clearing with a caravan and are ambushed.]MAGE: It\\'s Roche\\'s bitch! Kill them![The mage vanishes; Geralt dispatches his men.]BRIGIDA: They were expecting us...GERALT: No time to lose. How much further?BRIGIDA: Not far. We must stay on this path, it\\'s the shortest way.GERALT: You\\'ve gotten into some serious trouble...BRIGIDA: I should say so. Temeria is like a haystack, and the information I have is a burning torch. Fill the rest in for yourself.[At Brigida\\'s meeting place, they find a rowboat and a man\\'s corpse.]BRIGIDA: This is the smuggler I spoke of...GERALT: This was the smuggler you spoke of. Someone\\'s coming...[The mage and more men appear.]MAGE: You\\'ll not sail off, you whore. Kill her.[Geralt defeats the mage and his men.]BRIGIDA: Thank you... I\\'d not have survived on my own.GERALT: Talk, woman. You\\'ve dragged me far away from the city. You owe me an explanation. Who were those men? Who have you been hiding from?BRIGIDA: I... I don\\'t know...GERALT: Three days, like a rat, you said. And you don\\'t know?BRIGIDA: I knew... I mean, I had my suspicions.GERALT: So talk.Who were those men? GERALT: Who\\'s out to kill you?BRIGIDA: I don\\'t know.GERALT: There you go again.BRIGIDA: Truly, I cannot be sure... At first I thought it was revenge... for the children... But he knows I\\'m no traitor?GERALT: It\\'s not Roche. We both know that.BRIGIDA: Yes, yes.... You\\'re right.I need to hear about Maravel and Kimbolt. GERALT: Tell me about the vipers.BRIGIDA: They, they created this storm.GERALT: Are they working together?BRIGIDA: I would say they detest one another. Or that\\'s what they wish everyone to believe. The devil only knows.What\\'s Maravel like? GERALT: You know what the count intends?BRIGIDA: No. But I cannot imagine anyone more different from Baron Kimbolt.GERALT: Meaning?BRIGIDA: I would call him a sheep were his heart not black. He\\'s a jester, an especially nasty one, though I cannot identify his master. He may not even have one.Tell me about Kimbolt. GERALT: What does Baron Kimbolt want?BRIGIDA: A strong Temeria, and a strong North. He\\'s obsessed. He believes we\\'re surrounded by rebels and traitors - the La Valettes, the Maravels...GERALT: He\\'s probably not alone in that belief.BRIGIDA: But he is alone in believing that he himself is the remedy for that ailment. The baron sees himself on the Temerian throne - he claimed he would achieve this by marrying Anaïs.GERALT: Isn\\'t she a little young for him?BRIGIDA: He\\'s a disgusting old satyr. He\\'d be a tyrant were he to don the crown.You\\'ve learned quite a bit working for Roche. GERALT: Seems you got to know the baron and the count well. Then there\\'s Roche... Pretty interesting social life, I\\'d say.BRIGIDA: Being a courtier - that was no life for me. I thought it terribly dull and found a remedy.GERALT: Searching for excitement shouldn\\'t get you killed.BRIGIDA: It\\'s the last time I do anything of the sort.GERALT: You can\\'t be sure of that. Is Vernon the only person you do favors for?BRIGIDA: I\\'ve never betrayed Temeria, if that\\'s what you ask.What happened to the convoy? GERALT: What happened to the convoy carrying Anaïs and Boussy? What about the children?BRIGIDA: We were ambushed. The caravan was destroyed.GERALT: I need details.BRIGIDA: We were travelling along the agreed path, with a limited escort so as not to draw attention. The children were in two separate wagons - a safety measure, I was told.GERALT: Which one were you in?BRIGIDA: I was with Anaïs. One day a messenger appeared with orders for the caravan\\'s commander. A change of plans. We turned north to travel a longer route for safety\\'s sake. Soon after the turn-off, we were attacked.GERALT: Hm.BRIGIDA: The attackers were killing everyone indiscriminately. One pulled me from the wagon, but a bolt pierced his neck. It was mayhem. I ran for the bushes and hid.GERALT: Did you see what happened to the children?BRIGIDA: The driver of Boussy\\'s wagon was shot. The horses got spooked and ran off into the forest, taking the wagon with them. When the fighting was done, they found Anaïs, still in her wagon. I turned away for fear of what they might do, but they merely grabbed her and fled.GERALT: Any idea what happened to the caravan commander\\'s orders?BRIGIDA: I have them. After they took Anaïs, the bastards were in a hurry. They didn\\'t even think to search the corpses. Take them.GERALT: Thanks. Sure you can manage that boat?BRIGIDA: I must. I\\'ll not return to the city. Thank you again, witcher. And follow this through. You\\'ll do us all a favor.[Brigida gives Geralt a letter signed by Baron Kimbolt, to a man named Horst Lubovitz, ordering the convoy to change course. She escapes using the boat, and Geralt returns to Loc Muinne.]  7.3 - LILIES AND VIPERS: BARON KIMBOLT < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt enters Baron Kimbolt\\'s tent to find him in the middle of talking to a thug-looking man.]MAN: I believe there\\'s been a misunderstanding, m\\'Lord.KIMBOLT: Get out, before I call my guards.MAN: And what might I convey?KIMBOLT: Nothing.MAN: Baron, sir, you gave your word.KIMBOLT: For the last time. Out!KIMBOLT: Tend to this matter.[The guard next to Kimbolt, Garlen, peels away to obey.]GERALT: Baron Ravanen Kimbolt, I presume.KIMBOLT: Does that witchers\\' code of yours exempt you from court etiquette? Does it grant you the right to speak to the highborn without being asked to do so?GERALT: I guess I don\\'t need to introduce myself.KIMBOLT: Oh, no. I know who you are. Geralt of Rivia. Foltest\\'s other favorite hound, alongside Roche. Not purebred. They say you bring trouble wherever you appear.Who was that? GERALT: Who was that thug I passed in the doorway?KIMBOLT: He\\'s of no concern to you.Right. GERALT: We host who we want. True enough.He didn\\'t look happy. GERALT: People like him sometimes do stupid things.KIMBOLT: Did I ask for your opinion on the matter?What are you doing in Loc Muinne? GERALT: They\\'re gonna re-establish the Conclave. I didn\\'t expect so many Temerians to show up for the ceremony.KIMBOLT: We\\'re not here for some magic pomp and circumstance. This is about celebrating a new order in the Northern Kingdoms.GERALT: Is that so?KIMBOLT: Your kind doesn\\'t understand this yet, but your life is about to change - forever.GERALT: My kind?KIMBOLT: Wanderers and scoundrels. People, and I use the term loosely, without loyalty or country, people for whom coin is the law and everything\\'s for sale.What\\'s the situation in Temeria? GERALT: What\\'ll happen to Temeria?KIMBOLT: Is that a note of nostalgia I hear in your voice? Remembering your service under Foltest, or recalling some romp in the sack with the royal advisor? Whichever it may be, spare me your courtesy. You don\\'t care a lick about my country.Yeah, screw Temeria. GERALT: You\\'re right, I don’t. Now that Foltest\\'s dead, you\\'ll tear Temeria into bits, but luckily, I just don\\'t give a shit.KIMBOLT: Funny, because you sound as if you do.I decide what I care about. GERALT: I know what I care about. That\\'s why I asked.I asked for Roche\\'s sake. GERALT: I asked out of concern for a friend. I came here with Vernon Roche.KIMBOLT: I know.GERALT: We royal hounds like to stick together.KIMBOLT: Understand this - I\\'m talking to you only out of respect for Foltest, out of remembrance for him.GERALT: Haven\\'t seen much evidence of that remembrance - aside from the rewards on my head.KIMBOLT: They\\'d have hanged you if not for the testimony of little Anaïs.GERALT: So the girl finally talked.KIMBOLT: Whoever that monk was, to me, he was just like you.I\\'m no killer for hire. GERALT: I didn\\'t kill Foltest. That\\'s just one of the things that makes us different.KIMBOLT: Really? What else? Honor, principles?GERALT: I\\'m a witcher. I don\\'t kill humans for coin.KIMBOLT: Are you certain it\\'s not just a question of price? Tell me, Geralt - what were you doing at Foltest\\'s side that unfortunate day?I was there for Triss. GERALT: Triss Merigold. I was there for her.KIMBOLT: In that case you killed many for that woman. I hope she was worth it.I shouldn\\'t have been there. GERALT: You\\'re right, I should\\'ve turned Foltest down.KIMBOLT: The royal entourage is no place for a witcher.GERALT: We were supposed to leave after the battle. Triss and I. Foltest had already consented. I should\\'ve left before the battle.I was fighting for Temeria. GERALT: I was doing the right thing. You wouldn\\'t ask that question if I was an ordinary soldier.KIMBOLT: But you\\'re not. You\\'re not a soldier, you\\'re not even a Temerian.There\\'s some truth to that. GERALT: I\\'ll grant you that. You can\\'t even guess how similar we are, Baron.KIMBOLT: You\\'re a paid thug, even if you refuse to acknowledge it. That murky set of principles, values call them, you cast in the nearest corner when the price is right.GERALT: I\\'m not for sale.KIMBOLT: I\\'m not talking about coin, witcher. As a freak, you want what you\\'re most often denied. Camaraderie, respect... love. It is for those things that you scale walls and murder innocents. That is your price.There are no innocents at war. GERALT: They say there are no innocents at war.KIMBOLT: Indeed. At war there is but the cause you fight for. A higher calling. Though they also say war is a refuge for the cursed, an asylum for those stripped of heart and soul.Isn\\'t that what everyone does? GERALT: Killing for your loved ones. Hardly a new concept, as I see it.KIMBOLT: You did not fight to defend the sorceress Merigold nor the king, Geralt. You fought because you wished to be close to them. They had a higher calling, they knew the cause for which they went to war. Death is your daily fare. You murder like a dog who leaps at the throat his master indicates.GERALT: A higher calling. Beautiful concept. Except I remember the knights who stormed La Valette Castle. Highborn men fighting atop high walls. They were out to kill for fame, fortune, and pure enjoyment.GERALT: I was also at Vergen, where simple soldiers went into battle clutching false relics to their breast, knowing that death awaited them if they deserted.KIMBOLT: They owed it to their king.GERALT: If there\\'s one thing I love about being a witcher, it\\'s that I never draw my sword on someone else\\'s command.KIMBOLT: I tire of this discussion, witcher. Get to the point or leave.So, what\\'ll happen to Temeria? GERALT: I take it you sit on the Council of Regents.KIMBOLT: Not for much longer.GERALT: Why\\'s that?KIMBOLT: The council will become obsolete. Temeria is a country one rules with a crown on one\\'s head, or not at all.GERALT: A lot of people are out to don that crown.KIMBOLT: But few have the right. As Foltest\\'s cousin, the throne should be mine.GERALT: Or the royal daughter\\'s. Anaïs La Valette\\'s.KIMBOLT: Dark will be the day when we are ruled by bastards. The nobles have decided to share power.GERALT: You said it yourself, Baron - in a crown or not at all.KIMBOLT: Temeria will be divided into provinces. A shameful end to the monarchy. A shameful end to the country.I know you ordered the convoy to change course. GERALT: The convoy carrying Anaïs and Boussy was ambushed. Why?KIMBOLT: I\\'d like to know that myself.GERALT: I\\'ve seen your letter to Horst Lubbock. The one in which you ordered him to abandon the planned route.KIMBOLT: Nonsense! I sent no such letter.You\\'re lying. GERALT: You\\'re lying, Baron.KIMBOLT: Watch your words, wanderer. One nod from me and my people will riddle you with arrows before you can use any of your witchers\\' tricks.GERALT: What\\'re you waiting for?KIMBOLT: To hear the details of your slander.GERALT: The letter bears your seal and signature, Baron.KIMBOLT: Where is it?Unimportant. GERALT: That\\'s immaterial just now.KIMBOLT: If that\\'s the situation... I\\'ve said all I have to say. I wrote no such letter.GERALT: Words come cheap, Baron. I\\'m finding it hard to believe you.KIMBOLT: I care little for what you believe.KIMBOLT: If this letter exists, we are dealing with a forgery.Right here. GERALT: I have it.KIMBOLT: Show me.Swear that you\\'ll return it. GERALT: I need you to promise.KIMBOLT: What?GERALT: That I\\'ll get the letter back.KIMBOLT: I tire of your tone, witcher. Damn. So be it. I pledge to return the letter to you. I merely want to see this \"original\" with my own eyes.KIMBOLT: It is my seal. But the hand is forged, sloppily. We are dealing with a forgery.I\\'ll hang on to it. GERALT: You\\'ll have to take my word.KIMBOLT: The word of a wandering monster slayer means nothing to me.KIMBOLT: If that\\'s the situation... I\\'ve said all I have to say. I wrote no such letter.GERALT: Words come cheap, Baron. I\\'m finding it hard to believe you.KIMBOLT: I care little for what you believe.KIMBOLT: If this letter exists, we are dealing with a forgery.KIMBOLT: Whoever is behind this has crossed a Temerian noble. And will be duly punished.KIMBOLT: My scribe will test the letter and confirm what I claim.I\\'ll talk to him. GERALT: All right. I\\'ll see what this scribe has to say.Your people aren\\'t credible witnesses. GERALT: \"My claim,\" \"my scribe.\" I\\'d hardly call that impartial. Maybe I should just deliver the letter to Natalis.KIMBOLT: Any accusation will be quickly dismissed. Heed my words, witcher - it would be unwise of you to jump to any conclusions. Speak with my scribe.KIMBOLT: There are objective means of examining the letter\\'s authenticity. I promise to pay you well for learning the truth.GERALT: Hm. The truth does taste better when payment\\'s involved.[Geralt goes to see Kimbolt\\'s scribe.]GERALT: Drunker than a bard. Won\\'t get anything out of him. Maybe there\\'s something about testing letters in his notes.[Geralt finds the scribe\\'s notes in the nearby bookshelf, then goes to the scribe\\'s stills.]GERALT: According to the scribe\\'s notes, if this is Kimbolt\\'s letter, the paper it\\'s written on was treated with an invisible dye. An activator should bring out the dye, turning the paper blue. Now for the activator\\'s formula... Better try it on some drafts first.[Read the scribe\\'s notes.] GERALT: How did it go? \"Light, quench, shit, rinse. Thus you will the facts evince. To read the truth by lies deformed, guano into piss transform.\"[Test a letter.] GERALT: I need to make the substance that will bring out the dye and apply it to the letter.GERALT: Gotta be careful with this...[If Geralt fails with a draft letter] GERALT: Damn. Destroyed that letter. I need to be more careful.[If Geralt succeeds with a draft letter] GERALT: I need to add burnt lime to the flask, then quench it with water. Add bird guano to that, heat it, then capture the vapors and run them through cold water to obtain the final substance. All right, let\\'s try this on Kimbolt\\'s letter.[If Geralt fails with Kimbolt\\'s letter] GERALT: Shit. Now I\\'ll never know if the letter was fake.[If Geralt succeeds with Kimbolt\\'s letter] GERALT: A little burnt lime... A bit of water... Everything\\'s better with a dash of bird guano. Wait for it to dissolve...GERALT: Smells like piss, but it worked... The sheet\\'s orange, not blue - the letter\\'s fake. Kimbolt had nothing to do with this.[Geralt returns to Kimbolt to talk to him about the letter.]GERALT: You were right, Baron. The letter\\'s forged.KIMBOLT: Of course I was right. I would never seek to hurt Boussy. Bastard or not, he is still a child. Your payment, witcher.KIMBOLT: I want you to look into another matter.I don\\'t have time. GERALT: I don\\'t have time to do you any more favors.KIMBOLT: In that case, come see me when you find some more room in your pockets for gold.What would that be? GERALT: What would it involve?KIMBOLT: Count Linus Maravel. You\\'ve heard the name?GERALT: Young, capable, handsome.KIMBOLT: Yes, yes, all that and more. And he\\'s ambitious to a fault. Right after the Temerian delegation arrived in Loc Muinne, his people began visiting the Nilfgaardian camp - regularly.GERALT: Are you suggesting Maravel\\'s a traitor?KIMBOLT: *Sigh* We are all entitled to communicate with the ambassador, without chagrin and openly, as court and diplomatic protocols allow. Yet the count\\'s multiple messengers, the letters traveling to and fro - it reminds me more of a complicated courtship.GERALT: You\\'re curious to know the content of those letters.KIMBOLT: I want you to learn the count\\'s plans. The man would sell his mother to please the emperor. Find out what Maravel\\'s messenger is carrying. If treason is involved, you must alert John Natalis. You will be generously rewarded, I assure you.Why me? GERALT: You need a witcher to do this?KIMBOLT: Do not underestimate Count Maravel. He does not employ common scoundrels, and I don\\'t intend to either. Hieronymus Lash - sound familiar?GERALT: A pretentious, invented name. Belongs to a bard or a mummer, I\\'d say. But you wouldn\\'t need my help with either of those, so I\\'ll venture a guess - Maravel entrusts his correspondence to a mage.KIMBOLT: I knew you were suited to this task. The magic barrier placed over the city mutes all forms of high magic, preventing Lash from contacting Shilard remotely.KIMBOLT: He nevertheless remains dangerous. During the times of the previous Conclave, I believe he was caught practicing black magic. He faced execution, but that louse Maravel saved him.Where do I find this messenger? GERALT: How do I locate this messenger?KIMBOLT: Look for my man Aldrich by the fountain here in the camp. He\\'ll point the mage out to you.I\\'m not interested. GERALT: No matter what they say, I\\'m neither a killer for hire nor your errand boy. Wanna spy on your rival? Use your own people.KIMBOLT: You just shat on Foltest\\'s grave, witcher.GERALT: Farewell, Baron.Fine, I\\'ll do it. GERALT: All right. I\\'ll look into it.[Garlen, the soldier who Kimbolt sent after the thug in his quarters earlier, returns.]GARLEN: My lord. We know where they are. What are your orders?KIMBOLT: Bloody wonderful day. Assemble your men and resolve this once and for all.GARLEN: Gather your gear. We\\'re off to hunt.[As Geralt leaves Maravel\\'s quarters, a messenger runs up to him.]MESSENGER: Master witcher!GERALT: What do you want?MESSENGER: M\\'lord, the right honorable Count Maravel, requests the pleasure of your company. He says it\\'s urgent.GERALT: Seems like everything is these days. Tell the count I\\'ll think about it.  7.3.1 - THE MESSENGER < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to find Kimbolt\\'s man by the fountain.GERALT: Aldrich? Baron Kimbolt said you\\'d point Hieronymus Lash out to me.ALDRICH: Perfect timing. Come with me.[Aldrich leads Geralt to a corner near a pathway.]GERALT: Where\\'s Lash?ALDRICH: Patience, mate. They should be here any minute.[A man with a fancy staff on his back and fine clothes, tailed by two guards, walks down the path.]ALDRICH: Look, there they are. I\\'ve done my bit. Up to you now.[Geralt follows the men.]LASH: We\\'ve got a tail! Stop him!GUARD 1: Stop there, white one!GERALT: What if I don\\'t?GUARD 2: Then I\\'ll fuckin\\' help you.GERALT: I\\'d like to see you try.GUARD 2: Consider it done![Geralt dispatches Lash\\'s guards and follows him into the next courtyard, where a Nilfgaardian squadron waits.]LASH: That\\'s the one! Kill him![Geralt kills the Nilfgaardians and follows Lash into the next courtyard.]LASH: Enough! You shall die. Here and now.[Geralt kills the mage and takes the letter he was carrying, from Maravel to Shilard, confirming that Maravel has been conspiring with Nilfgaard and arranged for Anaïs to be handed over to Dethmold. Geralt returns to Kimbolt with the news.]GERALT: Maravel\\'s letters pretty much confirm your claim. The count is a traitor.KIMBOLT: What was in those letters?GERALT: That information is for Constable Natalis. State secret, I\\'m sure you understand, Baron.  7.4 - PACTA SUNT SERVANDA < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt goes to talk to Count Maravel.]MARAVEL: Ah-ha-ha-ha, Geralt of Rivia. I am delighted to see you among the living... and the free.GERALT: Are you serious, Count?MARAVEL: Such an injustice to lock you up without so much as a hearing. And then the beatings, the torture. It\\'s barbaric, I tell you - based on pure prejudice, the presumption of guilt.GERALT: Actually, if I\\'d seen what they saw...MARAVEL: But alas, such is my homeland: filled with fear and thus ruthless, cold as stone, dark and severe in aura and mindset.GERALT: I suppose there\\'s some truth to that.MARAVEL: A response at once cautious and reasonable. Admirable qualities in and of themselves, positively required in your profession.GERALT: If you say so.You don\\'t look very... Temerian. GERALT: I\\'ve gotta say you stand out, Count.MARAVEL: I\\'m flattered, I suppose, but what specifically do you mean?GERALT: I haven\\'t quite put my finger on it, but take a look around. Would you say you resemble your countrymen?MARAVEL: I thank the gods I do not. It is because I love my homeland that I am the first to note its faults. And they are many.GERALT: Care to elaborate?MARAVEL: Hypocrisy, superstition, lack of learning. Need I go on?No, I\\'ve heard enough. GERALT: Nah, I think I get where you\\'re coming from.You have my undivided attention. GERALT: If you wouldn\\'t mind.MARAVEL: Take you witchers, for instance. The gods know we suffer a plague of beasts - pre-Conjunction, post-Conjunction, magically bred and sprung from rotting marshes and the dark abysses of our land.GERALT: No such thing as pre-Conjunction creatures...MARAVEL: You bite unnecessarily. We have but one remedy for this plague, dwindling in numbers as it may be. Yet it is a remedy we revile. You are shunned, spat upon, turned away on stormy nights. Would you say this is reasonable?GERALT: It\\'s the way of things.MARAVEL: Spoken like a true representative of a dying species.What brings you to Loc Muinne? GERALT: What brings you to Loc Muinne?MARAVEL: Concern for my country, witcher, and an express and somewhat surprising request from Constable Natalis.GERALT: Surprising? How so?MARAVEL: Surely you jest, witcher. Truth be told, few could marshal loyal forces matching mine on such short order - Baron Kimbolt excepted. Yet though I very much held Foltest\\'s trust, I cannot say that many of my Temerian peers feel the same way.GERALT: Why do you suppose that is?MARAVEL: They resent me. I share neither their customs nor their beliefs.Brigida Papebrock - name sound familiar? GERALT: Does the name Brigida Papebrock ring any bells?MARAVEL: Rings bells, sets off whistles - why I believe my loins have grown warm. \"Touch my plums! Touch my plums!\"GERALT: Excuse me?MARAVEL: Fruit, witcher! Especially fruit of the south. Tender, juicy, soft on the exterior. That\\'s what I think of when you mention Dame Brigida. The woman is positively obsessed.GERALT: I was hoping for a straighter answer.MARAVEL: A man of your experience surely understands what I mean.GERALT: Hm. So, you admit you know her well.MARAVEL: I know her, I have known her, and I expect I yet will. And I\\'m not alone in that. Though mind you - I admire the woman. Her kind of ambition is rare, among both genders.GERALT: Ever taken advantage of that? Ever asked her to run errands for you?MARAVEL: One must be careful with the ambitious. They are almost always running their own errands. Asking them to do yours simply invites them to use you. Baron Kimbolt learned that the hard way. But why ask me about the lass? Here and now, of all times and places. Surely, given your close allegiance and, no doubt, many a shared drinking binge, Commander Roche has told you all.Baron Kimbolt - what\\'s the connection? GERALT: Brigida used Baron Kimbolt?MARAVEL: Continues to, I surmise.GERALT: To what end?MARAVEL: You cannot expect me to answer every little query that pops into your mind, witcher.What about Roche? GERALT: Commander Roche can be strangely discreet. What do you know?MARAVEL: I\\'m hardly one to tell another man\\'s secrets...GERALT: Indulge me.MARAVEL: *Sigh* If you must know, the rascal Roche rogered our dear Brigida. Just before he passed her off onto me, among others - with a purpose in mind, I suspect.GERALT: He\\'ll be interested to hear what you had to say.MARAVEL: My, my, aren\\'t we dutiful...?You wanted to see me? GERALT: What\\'s so urgent, Count?MARAVEL: *Sighs* Etiquette is not your enemy, witcher. It would not hurt you to embrace it at times. In any case, I could not help noticing you circulating in and out of Baron Kimbolt\\'s quarters. Yet I wonder if you are fully aware of the kind of man you serve...GERALT: What do you mean?MARAVEL: He cuts a fine figure, doesn\\'t he. The heavy cloak, the silver mane, the booming voice... Yet our worthy baron is hardly the saint he makes himself out to be.GERALT: A lot of that going around recently...MARAVEL: I am in possession of certain information that might interest you.GERALT: Mhm. And you want to share it because...?MARAVEL: We come from different worlds, witcher. On the surface, we are as unlike as wraiths and wyverns. Yet, no matter our preferences - culinary, political, erotic - ultimately we both are interested in, and tirelessly seek, one and the same thing: the truth.Hard not to agree. GERALT: Only a fool would disagree. Tell me what you know.MARAVEL: I saw through you immediately, witcher. I\\'m content I was not mistaken.The truth varies. GERALT: You can talk, Count, I\\'ll grant you that. But I\\'m not convinced you can be trusted. Baron Kimbolt also offered me the chance to learn a certain truth. I don\\'t think I need to say who about.MARAVEL: And you are certain that Kimbolt can be trusted?GERALT: So far, all the baron\\'s words have proved true.MARAVEL: Well then I merely ask that you verify mine.MARAVEL: You are not the sole person to have repeatedly visited our kind-hearted baron recently.GERALT: Doesn\\'t seem strange to me, given the time and the place.MARAVEL: He has also had some more troublesome callers. Blackmailers, to be specific. Now, I\\'m not handing down any verdicts. Perhaps the baron has some personal problems - in which case I would very much like to help him.GERALT: Get to the point, Count.MARAVEL: My people have learned where these blackmailers are encamped. I assume Baron Kimbolt has not been sitting on his hands and has also dispatched his huntsman to find them. A horrible man.GERALT: I know who you mean. Ran into him in Kimbolt\\'s quarters.MARAVEL: Then you must also know that if you do not make haste, nothing will be left of our blackmailers save some rotting corpses. I shall show you where they have their camp. And I merely ask that you learn what is at issue. Naturally, you can count on my gratitude, though we both know that is not the greatest reward.GERALT: I can\\'t promise you anything, Count. But I\\'ll think about it. Farewell.[Geralt goes to the location Maravel gave him to find the thug he saw talking to Kimbolt earlier and some other men.]MERCENARY: What do you want?GERALT: I saw you talking to Kimbolt.MERCENARY: I\\'m free to go where I please and talk to whoever I please...GERALT: Couldn\\'t agree more. Now you\\'re here and you\\'ll talk to me. I\\'m interested in the baron.MERCENARY: I\\'ve naught to say to ye.GERALT: Not good, \\'cause I need to know everything you know about him.[Kimbolt\\'s men arrive on the scene.]GARLEN: Baron Kimbolt sends his regards.MERCENARY: Aww, just what we needed...GARLEN: Leave us, witcher.GERALT: Since when does a witcher take orders from a huntsman?GARLEN: Since that witcher stopped hunting monsters and started poking his nose into others\\' affairs.GERALT: Sometimes the stench is so strong you can\\'t help but catch a whiff.GARLEN: Aye, well spoken. You\\'ve some common, stinking thugs here, and I\\'m to teach them some humility.MERCENARY: A ponce like you? Pucker up and kiss my arse, you fuckin\\' tulip.Let me get out of your way. GERALT: Hm. I wasn\\'t getting much out of them. Do what you will.Leave them alone. GARLEN: These folk have nothing to say to you, understand?GERALT: I\\'ll be the judge of that.MERCENARY: Lend us a hand, witcher. You\\'ll not regret it.GERALT: I\\'ll need to know everything about Kimbolt.GARLEN: Aww, this is shit! Enough of your jabbering! Kill them all![Kimbolt\\'s men attack, and Geralt fights with the blackmailers.]MERCENARY: Ugh, thanks, witcher. We\\'d be corpses if not for you.GERALT: Yeah, seems likely. Now, don\\'t make me regret helping you.MERCENARY: You\\'re welcome to all we know about Kimbolt.GERALT: I\\'m all ears.MERCENARY: We came here to collect our fee, me and me brothers - for a favor we did the baron.GERALT: What did you do for him?MERCENARY: Spent four days in a forest, sitting on our arses.GERALT: Baron Kimbolt wanted to pay you for that?MERCENARY: Course not. We was to destroy some wagons in a caravan that was to pass through Millville. Problem is, caravan never came round.GERALT: I can see why you\\'re having trouble collecting.MERCENARY: Kimbolt had shite information - how is that our fault? That bugger lost us a right lot of time. And you know what they say - time is coin.GERALT: What exactly were your orders?MERCENARY: We was to watch the high road for a caravan carrying nobles - two colored wagons and a small escort. The wagons - they was ours. All inside was to perish.GERALT: Any idea who was supposed to be in the wagons?MERCENARY: Two highborn young\\'uns and their nannies. That\\'s all the baron told us.GERALT: Willing to tell Natalis all this?MERCENARY: I\\'m to fess up? They\\'d draw and quarter me!GERALT: You didn\\'t do anything. Took a job - that\\'s it. They can\\'t prove you actually wanted to complete it. If you refuse, Kimbolt wins. He\\'ll squirm his way out of this, but it won\\'t end there. The baron\\'s got gold enough to hunt you till he hunts you down.MERCENARY: Not likely. I\\'ll see them tear stripes off his back with hot pincers. All right. I\\'ll talk to Natalis.[Geralt returns to Maravel.]The lead you gave me checked out. GERALT: I found the baron\\'s blackmailers.MARAVEL: And? Did Kimbolt knock up a peasant girl? A healthy one, at least?GERALT: Unfortunately, it\\'s a national matter, not a personal one.MARAVEL: May I know its essence? As a statesman, matters pertaining to Temeria are of the utmost concern to me.GERALT: It looks like Kimbolt hired this group to murder Anaïs and Boussy.MARAVEL: Thank the gods they were only half successful.GERALT: Hm. This group didn\\'t kill anyone. The convoy carrying Foltest\\'s children changed course. It never arrived where our blackmailers were waiting.MARAVEL: I know the baron - he approaches things comprehensively. He must have enlisted a second group, which accomplished the terrible deed.GERALT: Whichever way you cut it, Kimbolt\\'s a traitor - pure and simple.MARAVEL: Oh my! Must have hit the old man pretty hard.GERALT: The baron doesn\\'t know yet.MARAVEL: What are you waiting for, witcher? Make haste - you must deliver the evidence to the interrex!GERALT: Actually, I was hoping you\\'d do that. I need to tend to some other matters.MARAVEL: Knowing the constable, I fear he would look upon any accusation I made with distaste. He could very well assume I was merely trying to subvert a natural rival. He might see the evidence as doubtful, even fabricated. But we cannot allow a traitor to play an important role during the summit.GERALT: Yeah, I guess we can\\'t.MARAVEL: Besides... To witness the fall of the honorable Baron Kimbolt - I don\\'t know if I could bear it...GERALT: Hm. I gotta admit, Count. Your clearly feigned concern for Kimbolt... Well, it makes me wonder...MARAVEL: Yes... I suppose it must... Goodbye, witcher.GERALT: Farewell, Count.  7.5 - LILIES AND VIPERS: NATALIS\\' JUDGMENT < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[After collecting his evidence, Geralt goes to see Natalis.]NATALIS: Roche may trust you, but I\\'m not so sure. What do you want?The Council of Regents. GERALT: Representatives of the Council of Regents - did any come with you?NATALIS: Only Baron Kimbolt and Count Maravel. The other five remain in Vizima. It seems that save Baron Orvall, most spend their time trying to devise a way to undermine Anaïs\\' claim to the throne.GERALT: Kimbolt and Maravel - what\\'s their stance?NATALIS: They\\'ve taken opposing positions, as one might expect.NATALIS: The baron believes Anaïs\\' origin, if you will, stands in the way of her taking the throne. Though it\\'s common knowledge that he would simply prefer to seat himself on it. Whereas Maravel has said that Foltest\\'s children have his full support. He stated this in Vizima, before the entire council.NATALIS: One thing is certain - words come cheap. Those two may change their minds in a flash if Anaïs is found and recovered.Several important people will be absent from the summit. GERALT: Impressive summit, but not all the players have their representatives here.NATALIS: The most important do. The mages thought about inviting everyone, but time is short.And Aedirn? GERALT: What about Aedirn? It\\'s a huge country.NATALIS: Torn by conflict and rebellion, with no clear ruler. They\\'re not to be taken seriously at this point.GERALT: Sounds like the Kaedweni point of view. The Aedirnians see it differently, I\\'m sure.What about Nilfgaard? GERALT: I\\'ve seen a Nilfgaardian delegation.NATALIS: Scandalous, as I see it. They\\'re here at Henselt\\'s bidding. Before long, he\\'ll be inviting them to his war councils.You think you can strike a deal with the mages? GERALT: The mages will want to get as much as they can out of this summit. And monarchs don\\'t generally like others dictating terms. This may end in a row.NATALIS: There will be no row. The mages now rely on the mercy of the Northern Kingdoms. The amphitheatre itself is also protected by an antimagic shield, like the one used at Thanedd. The times of mage impunity are gone. They will be shown their place.I know what happened to the royal children. GERALT: There\\'s a traitor among the Temerians.NATALIS: Careful, witcher. You\\'d better have evidence if you plan to accuse someone of treason.GERALT: Boussy and Anaïs...NATALIS: Yes?[Here, if Geralt has followed through on all of the threads of evidence, he can choose to accuse either Kimbolt, Maravel, or both.][Accuse Kimbolt.] GERALT: Anaïs was kidnapped on Baron Kimbolt\\'s orders.NATALIS: Have you any proof?[If you did not find the mercenaries] GERALT: A letter I got from Brigida Papebrock.NATALIS: Dame Papebrock is alive?GERALT: Yeah, but she\\'s far away by now.NATALIS: Kimbolt\\'s signature and official seal. It does appear the baron arranged everything. I am grateful to you, witcher.[If you found the mercenaries] GERALT: The baron hired a group of thugs. They were supposed to murder both children.NATALIS: Why then did Boussy alone perish?GERALT: The convoy changed course. A second group was waiting along the new route. It\\'s possible they decided to take Anaïs hostage, just to be sure they\\'d get paid.NATALIS: Have you anything to confirm your claims?GERALT: One of the thugs I found is ready to testify.NATALIS: I see. We will hear him out then.[Natalis and Geralt go to Maravel.]NATALIS: So you see, Count, I find myself in an unenviable position, one in which I require the support of your forces in arresting Baron Kimbolt.MARAVEL: Baron Kimbolt, a child slayer... Gods protect us.NATALIS: Can I rely on you, Count?MARAVEL: The very thought of standing against a highborn peer fills me with trepidation, but a crime this cruel cannot go unpunished. Consider myself and my forces at your disposal, John Natalis.[Kimbolt is arrested.]GERALT: I guess you were glad to see them put Baron Kimbolt in chains.MARAVEL: It is a triumph, witcher. For Temeria, to be sure, but more importantly for truth. I am delighted you chose to see the matter through - and all Temeria is indebted.GERALT: Yeah. About that. Any chance you could satisfy that debt, as an elder statesman and all?MARAVEL: Coin seems so coarse as a means of crowning such an achievement.GERALT: Can you think of a better means?MARAVEL: I suppose not... Take this, witcher. I wager you will see it as generous and spend it on something... worthy.GERALT: I\\'ll try not to disappoint you, Count. Farewell.MARAVEL: And you, witcher. And you.[Accuse Maravel.] GERALT: You have a traitor in your camp, Constable.NATALIS: I know what the Temerian nobles think of me. They have no love for me and seek to subvert me at every step. And that is how it will stay as long as the throne remains vacant.GERALT: I\\'m not talking about you. Count Maravel is responsible for Boussy\\'s death, and for Anaïs landing in Kaedweni hands.NATALIS: A grave charge, witcher.GERALT: This letter clearly shows Count Maravel\\'s men ambushed the convoy carrying Foltest\\'s children. The boy was killed during the assault. They kidnapped Anaïs and then handed her over to the Nilfgaardians.NATALIS: Why? For what amount of gold, for what swathes of land did that tub of lard, dripping with wealth, go so far as to commit treason against the state? I thank you, witcher. You have done us all no small favor, though the count\\'s trial will bring its own share of grief.[Natalis and Geralt go to Kimbolt.]NATALIS: That is the state of affairs, Baron. Count Linus Maravel is a traitor. He has betrayed us, he has betrayed Temeria, he has betrayed the entire North.KIMBOLT: You have at last seen the light, Constable, and I am content. We must show the count that even in this trying hour Temeria remains strong, united.[Maravel is arrested.]GERALT: Baron, about that generous reward you mentioned. I\\'m here to collect.KIMBOLT: I see I was not wrong about you. A thug for hire, nothing more.[Accuse Kimbolt and Maravel.]GERALT: Count Maravel outright betrayed Temeria. While Baron Kimbolt planned to murder Foltest\\'s children.NATALIS: Those are serious charges.GERALT: Kimbolt hired some thugs to do the wet work for him. I found them, and one\\'s ready to testify.GERALT: They never got the job done because the convoy carrying the children changed course - only to fall into an ambush set by Maravel. The count wanted to hand Anaïs and Boussy over to the Nilfgaardians. You\\'ll find the proof in this letter. Boussy\\'s death was an accident.NATALIS: Dark clouds gather over Temeria. I cannot arrest them both. Their contingents are among the largest in Loc Muinne, and I cannot risk mutiny by their men.NATALIS: Thank you, witcher. You did well to bring this matter to my attention. I only hope Baron Kimbolt will agree to stand with me.[Natalis and Geralt go to Kimbolt.]NATALIS: So you see, Baron, I have learned all. And it makes me sick to think about it. However, you may count yourself fortunate, for we\\'ve a greater problem to deal with. You shall provide me with your full support as we arrest Count Maravel.KIMBOLT: This plea sounds more like a threat to me, Constable.NATALIS: It is no plea, it is an order and yes, a threat. Refuse and the Council of Regents shall receive ample evidence of your crime. Of your wish to slay the children from whom our king gave his life.KIMBOLT: What are your terms, Natalis?NATALIS: Upon returning to Vizima, I shall destroy the evidence against you. Prior to that, however, I expect your unconditional support.KIMBOLT: How can I be certain you will do as you pledge?NATALIS: My word still means something, unlike yours, you lying, rotting son of a whore.KIMBOLT: So be it. But heed this, Constable - do not try to cross me.[Maravel is arrested.]  7.6 - WHERE IS TRISS MERIGOLD? < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt can either assist Roche with retrieving Anaïs, or he can go rescue Triss. If he chooses Triss, he overhears Shilard talking to a soldier outside the Nilfgaardian camp.]SHILARD: You are to guard the camp like it\\'s the Emperor\\'s treasure.SOLDIER: Yes, Your Excellency.SHILARD: Let so much as a flea slip through, and you shall pay with your heads.SHILARD: Look who\\'s here... the Rivian witcher...GERALT: Greetings.SHILARD: Our paths cross often, it seems.GERALT: Too often.SHILARD: What do you seek here?Nothing, goodbye. GERALT: Nothing I can tell you about.SHILARD: Begone then.You mean who. I know you have Triss. GERALT: Triss Merigold.SHILARD: In the Nilfgaardian camp? Fisstech has addled your brain.[Geralt takes Shilard hostage.]GERALT: A- ah! Lower your sword, son.SHILARD: You\\'ve got cheek, Geralt.GERALT: Let\\'s go.GERALT: One false move and your ambassador will never see Nilfgaard\\'s sun again.SHILARD: My men won\\'t let you leave here alive.GERALT: They will if you ask them to, Excellency. And I believe you will.SHILARD: Renuald aep Matsen\\'s orders come from the Emperor himself. He\\'d rather die than give you Merigold.GERALT: Then he\\'ll die.SHILARD: No, mark my words, you will. Unless you release me. It\\'s not too late.GERALT: You\\'re boring me. Pick up the pace.SHILARD: Why do you care for that sorceress so much?GERALT: Go.SHILARD: Are you in love with her? A poor choice, even for you.GERALT: That cuts no ice with me.[Geralt and Shilard enter the camp.]GERALT: Out of the way, all of you! Or the old man dies.RENUALD: Hold there!GERALT: I\\'m not joking.RENUALD: I know, and I advise you not to hesitate! Kill him, for we shan\\'t move one bit!SHILARD: Renuald...RENUALD: He who brings me the witcher\\'s head will get the Order of Merit.SOLDIER: But... Ambassador Fitz-Oesterlen...RENUALD: Your Excellency, hm... Orders from the capital...[Renuald shoots Shilard.]GERALT: Now I\\'ll have to kill you all.RENUALD: What are you waiting for? Get him.[Geralt defeats the Nilfgaardians.]GERALT: The gate\\'s closed. There must be another way in...[Geralt climbs a nearby ladder onto the tops of the walls and goes around. He drops down and fights through Renuald\\'s soldiers.]RENUALD: Congratulations, witcher. They were my best men.Choose better ones next time. GERALT: You should have picked them more carefully. Or trained them better.RENUALD: Or perhaps they were ready for any foe but you...?GERALT: Free Triss or join them.RENUALD: You amaze me. How can you risk your life for a witch?She\\'s my friend. GERALT: There are things you and your kind will never comprehend.RENUALD: And what are those?GERALT: Friendship.RENUALD: Tell me, is the friendship of traitors and conspirators worth it?We\\'re close. GERALT: Let\\'s just say we\\'re close.RENUALD: I knew it - you\\'re in love with her. You wouldn\\'t risk your neck otherwise. But you don\\'t know everything about her.I need her. GERALT: She has information that\\'s very important to me.RENUALD: Ah, that I understand. You\\'re exceptionally reasonable for a Nordling.GERALT: Thanks. It means a lot to hear you say that.RENUALD: It should. Because I, in turn, have information about her which you may find interesting.GERALT: What are you talking about?RENUALD: Your friend and the other witches conspired against your rulers.That\\'s impossible. GERALT: You lie.RENUALD: You think it impossible?GERALT: Triss was loyal to the crown...RENUALD: You\\'re a fool. That\\'s what happens when tits take over a man\\'s mind.Interesting, go on. GERALT: How do you know that?RENUALD: From the best possible source. She confessed.GERALT: And how did you convince her to do that?RENUALD: By showing her the confessions of other Lodge members.GERALT: I don\\'t believe you.RENUALD: That\\'s irrelevant at this point. During our chat, my people managed to regroup, call for reinforcements.GERALT: Maybe now they\\'ll start fighting like men.RENUALD: Time to show you the Empire\\'s true power! [As they talked, reinforcements arrived. Geralt fights through the additional soldiers and kills Renuald, taking the prison keys from his body. He finds Triss in the dungeons, and unchains her from the wall.]TRISS: Geralt...?GERALT: Didn\\'t expect to see me?TRISS: Are you kidding? The only person you expect to see in a Nilfgaardian dungeon is the executioner.GERALT: Did they torture you?TRISS: They tried various... things, but they got nothing from me.GERALT: When I left Flotsam with Vernon, I somehow doubted I\\'d find you so soon.TRISS: I know it was hard on you. I\\'ll never forget this, you hear? Never...I couldn\\'t leave you. GERALT: I\\'d slaughter half the Nilfgaardian army for a friend.GERALT: I know you\\'re a member of the Lodge, Triss.TRISS: How do you know of the Lodge?GERALT: Does it matter? I also know the Lodge was behind Demavend\\'s assassination.TRISS: Geralt, I...GERALT: I trust you.The Lodge didn\\'t help you? GERALT: Couldn\\'t you ask your friends from the Lodge for help?TRISS: How do you know of the Lodge?GERALT: I just do. Listen, Triss... To come here for you, I had to split up with Vernon. Temeria is in danger of disintegrating...TRISS: Are you sorry you chose to come here?GERALT: No, I\\'m not. But freeing you from Shilard\\'s grasp was not my only reason for coming here. I need you to explain your role in this mess. And to explain why you lied to me.TRISS: That\\'s not true!GERALT: I know about the Lodge. I know the Lodge was behind Demavend\\'s assassination. I know Triss Merigold is a member of the Lodge.TRISS: It\\'s not like that...GERALT: Show me the error in my reasoning.TRISS: True, I\\'m a member of the Lodge. Just like eight other sorceresses. But if you think I\\'m responsible for the Lodge\\'s actions, you\\'re badly mistaken. The Lodge is a theater for two actresses. Síle and Philippa have long dominated it.GERALT: To the point where you didn\\'t know about the murder they planned?TRISS: To the point where I was no longer invited to gatherings.GERALT: Why?TRISS: They stopped trusting me.GERALT: Because you didn\\'t agree with them?TRISS: Nine women very rarely agree on anything. The actual problem was that...GERALT: Tell me...TRISS: I was close to you. If Síle fears anyone, it\\'s Geralt of Rivia... The Lodge did everything to convince me that our relationship didn\\'t bother them, even that it suited them. But they manipulated me. Through me, they fed you select information. Depending on the circumstances, they twisted facts.GERALT: We\\'re still close. They could still be doing it.TRISS: Don\\'t insult me.I don\\'t trust you. GERALT: I\\'d say the same thing in your place.TRISS: I\\'m telling you the truth!GERALT: You have no idea how much I want to believe you. But you\\'ve lied once. Why wouldn\\'t you do it again?TRISS: I never lied to you... I just didn\\'t tell you everything...GERALT: How is that not lying?TRISS: I didn\\'t know the truth! I had suspicions, that\\'s all, and once I was finally certain... It was too late. I can prove everything.I believe you. GERALT: Calm down, Triss. Renuald aep Matsen claimed otherwise, but I\\'ll always take your word over that of some Nilfgaardian lowlife\\'s.GERALT: Now, you\\'ll tell me everything you know. I need to learn the truth.TRISS: All existing councils of mages disintegrated after the Thanedd massacre. We all acted separately. Philippa decided to create a new organization. A secret one this time. When I was sworn in, it never crossed my mind that the Lodge\\'s plans would soon become secret to its members. As you know, Philippa\\'s not one for minor undertakings. She presented a plan for creating a powerful state controlled by sorceresses.No wonder the kings don\\'t like the mages. GERALT: No wonder the kings are opposing the sorceresses. Nobody likes a schemer.Good idea - too bad it\\'s completely unachievable. GERALT: The best laid schemes of mages and men...TRISS: Philippa and Síle never lacked ideas or enthusiasm. To control a powerful state, they needed to create one first. Or find a wealthy land with a suitable political arrangement and an easily manipulated ruler. Síle chose the Pontar Valley... Demavend... And Stennis...A strange choice. GERALT: Demavend hated mages.TRISS: No more than Henselt or Radovid. Síle and Philippa saw Demavend as the weakest ruler. His son, Stennis, blows hot and cold... Plus, he who controls the Pontar Valley, controls the North. So, it was in Aedirn that a popular rebel emerged preaching the idea of a new state.I\\'d choose the same in her place. GERALT: I\\'d choose the same if I were her. Demavend didn\\'t have a network of spies anywhere near as good as Henselt\\'s or Radovid\\'s.TRISS: Nor could he count on the loyalty of such men as our dear Vernon Roche.TRISS: At one of our meetings, I just asked how they imagined overthrowing Demavend. That was the last time I was invited. After Demavend\\'s death I became suspicious, but had no evidence. Philippa brushed me off.TRISS: When you went off to meet Iorveth and Síle was busy with the kayran\\'s carcass, I managed to scan parts of her megascope. That\\'s when I learned that Síle had dealings with Letho.Why didn\\'t you tell me? GERALT: Why didn\\'t you tell me?TRISS: I wanted to! But we never met after that!Pity I didn\\'t know about that. GERALT: If only I\\'d learned that, everything could\\'ve been different.TRISS: Letho must have shadowed me when I entered Síle\\'s room. Then he forced me to teleport us to somewhere near Vergen.GERALT: Did you talk to him?TRISS: He wasn\\'t aggressive. In Vergen he told me that Síle commissioned them to assassinate Demavend. Them being the witchers of the School of the Viper. Síle helped them prepare the assassination.GERALT: I wonder why he told you about it.TRISS: Is that important?GERALT: Conspirators who suddenly divulge everything? I\\'d be suspicious.TRISS: There was some interference as we teleported to Aedirn. I emerged intact, but pretty battered. I knew Philippa was in the area. I decided to go see her and lay my cards on the table.GERALT: Maybe Letho wanted just that...TRISS: I met a woman at Philippa\\'s house. Thought she was just a servant, or Philippa\\'s lover. Before I could speak, I was overpowered by spells. I hardly expected an attack...TRISS: The pain I felt as my body was compressed, it\\'s indescribable. As if all my bones were being broken... It\\'s even worse when you return to your true form. In any case, Philippa had no idea her lover was a Nilfgaardian spy. I was carried as that figurine all the way to Loc Muinne. Assire decompressed me back, just before they murdered her.TRISS: Shilard interrogated me, but learned nothing. If it wasn\\'t for you... They\\'d have had me quartered. I didn\\'t piece the puzzle together until I was here, in the dungeon. Now you know everything.Saskia knew of the Lodge\\'s plans? GERALT: Did Saskia know the Lodge\\'s plans?TRISS: She didn\\'t even know the Lodge existed. Philippa told her that the sorceresses would support an independent state in the Pontar Valley, no strings attached. A fairytale, but Saskia bought it. Saskia backed Philippa, and the people backed Saskia.Who ordered Foltest killed? GERALT: Who had Foltest assassinated?TRISS: I have no idea. Perhaps after Demavend\\'s successful assassination, Síle and Philippa decided to take the next step.GERALT: That would be stupid. Killing Demavend was a way to take control of the Pontar Valley. People would forget the regicide in a year, and the Lodge could put it\\'s plan in motion. They had to know that if Foltest died, men like Roche wouldn\\'t rest until they learned why that had happened.TRISS: One thing is certain. Letho killed Foltest. And Síle was working with Letho.What was Síle actually doing in Flotsam? GERALT: Ever find out what Síle was actually doing in Flotsam? I find it hard to believe she went there just to kill a monster and earn a few orens.TRISS: You\\'re right, of course. It had something to do with Letho and the Scoia\\'tael.GERALT: What did she want from Iorveth?TRISS: The Scoia\\'tael were Saskia\\'s trump card. I expect Síle needed to know what the elves would do given that a war with Henselt was practically inevitable.That\\'ll have to do for now. GERALT: That\\'ll have to do for now.TRISS: We\\'ll learn more at the talks.GERALT: You\\'re going to attend?TRISS: You have no memory of how the world worked before the Thanedd massacre.GERALT: Actually, I know exactly how it worked.TRISS: That means...GERALT: We\\'ll talk about my memory later.TRISS: All right...TRISS: If the Council and Conclave still existed, kings wouldn\\'t be assassinated and massacres would be less frequent. This is our chance to restore these institutions and we shouldn\\'t miss it. Normalizing relations between the rulers and the mages who advise them is our only chance for peace.GERALT: And our only chance to dismantle the Lodge.TRISS: The Lodge will disintegrate anyway. Once the kings learn it was behind the assassinations, they\\'ll start a witch hunt. We can prevent that from happening. I\\'m all for punishing the guilty, but can\\'t abide collective responsibility. I\\'m ready to go and reveal everything I know about Philippa Eilhart, Síle de Tansarville, and their schemes.GERALT: Let\\'s go, then.TRISS: Those Nilfgaardians... that\\'s your work?GERALT: They followed their leader too blindly.TRISS: You killed them all?GERALT: They didn\\'t slaughter themselves.[Geralt and Triss exit the Nilfgaardian camp.]TRISS: We shouldn\\'t arrive at the same time. Let\\'s split up.I don\\'t want to lose you again. GERALT: Triss...TRISS: Yes?GERALT: That was some mess. I wouldn\\'t want to see you hurt like that again.Don\\'t trust the other sorceresses. GERALT: The Lodge remembers, too.TRISS: Rest assured, I won\\'t let anyone compress me again.GERALT: Some of the sorceresses will be surprised to see you. Watch them closely.TRISS: Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll manage. See you at the talks.GERALT: All right.[Continues with A Summit of Mages (Triss).]  7.7 - OF HIS BLOOD AND BONE < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt can either assist Roche with retrieving Anaïs, or he can go rescue Triss. If he chooses Roche, he meets him in the town square.]ROCHE: Can we go?I found out what happened to Anaïs and Boussy. GERALT: Brigida Papebrock - she gave me some pretty good leads.ROCHE: Tell me.GERALT: Baron Kimbolt hired some thugs to murder the royal bastards.ROCHE: Son of a bitch. Foltest never trusted him. Turns out he was right not to.GERALT: It was Count Maravel who kidnapped Anaïs. He wanted to hand both children over to the Nilfgaardians, but Boussy was killed.ROCHE: Damn it all. Radovid is one thing, but Nilfgaard? When I get my hands on Maravel...[If accused Kimbolt] GERALT: Natalis arrested the baron. Kimbolt will be tried in Vizima.[If accused Maravel] GERALT: You won\\'t. Natalis arrested the count with Baron Kimbolt\\'s support. Maravel will be tried in Vizima.[If accused both] GERALT: You won\\'t. I delivered the evidence against both of them to Natalis, but the constable decided to ask Kimbolt for help and arrested Maravel.ROCHE: Wise. There will come a time for Kimbolt as well, but Maravel needed to be removed immediately. A traitor is a traitor.ROCHE: They should take off his head.Yeah, I\\'m ready. GERALT: Let\\'s do this.ROCHE: Dethmold is a dead man.GERALT: I\\'m guessing you don\\'t have a plan...ROCHE: In fact, I do. We need to kill Dethmold and rescue the royal child.GERALT: You never did like playing it by ear.ROCHE: I learned from the best.[Geralt and Roche enter the sewers under Loc Muinne.]GUARD 1: See that? Dethmold\\'s put up that magic barrier again. Apparently, not a single sound seeps through.GUARD 2: I dread to think what he\\'s doing inside...[Geralt and Roche approach the gate.]GUARD 1: Why are you here!?ROCHE: We have business with Dethmold.GUARD 2: The sorcerer is busy. No one\\'s to disturb him!GERALT: Recognize me?GUARD 1: Should we?GERALT: Course you should! Unless you don\\'t care about being promoted.GUARD 1: Huh? Who are you?[Distract the guard.] GERALT: Now![Geralt and Roche yank the guards forward and knock them out against the gate, stealing their keys and entering. Roche locks the door behind them.]ROCHE: This is my banquet. I don\\'t want any unwanted guests.GERALT: More are bound to arrive soon.ROCHE: Well, let them come.ROCHE: Quickly, up top![The wall above has two arbalists, who fire on Roche and Geralt; Geralt deflects the bolts, and Roche takes out one arbalist by throwing his sword. Geralt boosts Roche\\'s flying leap, sending him up over the wall, where he dispatches the other arbalist.]ROCHE: The low road\\'s yours, I\\'ll take the walls.[Geralt fights his way through some Kaedweni soldiers, dodging balls of lightning from Dethmold\\'s apprentice, who vanishes into a portal when he approaches.]ROCHE: You were better off making hay, bumpkin!ROCHE: We\\'re doing well, Geralt![Geralt and Roche dispatch Dethmold\\'s men and attack his apprentice. When the mage falls, the fiery barrier into Dethmold\\'s basement evaporates.]ROCHE: What\\'s he doing in there?GERALT: Sounds like he\\'s awfully busy.ROCHE: Rude as it is, I\\'ll have to interrupt.ROCHE: Strangely quiet in here...GERALT: I can hear him. Dethmold\\'s here and he\\'s not alone.[In the basement is Anaïs, trapped behind a magical barrier, and (if Henselt is dead) Henselt\\'s corpse, laid out on a bower.][If Henselt is dead, a character animatic plays.\\xa0GERALT, NARRATING: There is one crime that all civilizations consider irredeemable and unforgivable: regicide. A transgression of laws both human and divine. A blow to the vital organs of society. That is why those in power create bloody havoc and wallow in it. They are never punished. Not subject to moral judgments, they stand above the law. Henselt\\'s blood now stains Roche\\'s hands and mine. I could have stopped him, but I didn\\'t want to. Now Henselt is a cold corpse. And the Blue Stripes, in the world beyond, are laughing.][In the other room Dethmold is grooming himself, while a half-naked man lays on his bed.]DETHMOLD: Tam, taram, tam, tam...DETHMOLD: Did you see Radovid\\'s retinue? I swear the snot-nose lad thinks he\\'s king of the world. He should never have shown up here after the recent events in Redania.DETHMOLD: Honestly, if he grows to be another Vizimir, I hope he ends up like the first. And those robes of his, did you see?DETHMOLD: Ah, all right... there\\'s time for one more. Pants off.[Geralt and Roche burst in. Roche attacks immediately, striking Dethmold on the arm.]DETHMOLD: Ahh... Arghhh! You\\'ve broken my arm! Do you know its worth, you son of a bitch?!ROCHE: Now it\\'s worth shit, like the rest of you.DETHMOLD: What do you want?... I\\'ll give you anything.ROCHE: You can\\'t give back what you took from me. Cutting off your balls and slitting your throat will have to do.DETHMOLD: No... Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!ROCHE: You reap what you sow.ROCHE: Time to free Foltest\\'s daughter.[Geralt and Roche run back to the cell. Dethmold\\'s barrier has disintegrated.]ROCHE: Are you all right? I am Vernon Roche of Temeria. This is Witcher Geralt.GERALT: She\\'s terrified.ROCHE: If Dethmold touched her, I\\'ll kill the son of a bitch all over again.GERALT: What\\'ll you do with the child, Vernon?ROCHE: I made an arrangement with Radovid. And Vernon Roche always keeps to his word.Let\\'s go, then. GERALT: So be it. Let\\'s go.ROCHE: Don\\'t be afraid. I was your father\\'s soldier. I\\'ll not let anyone harm you...Kings don\\'t always keep their word... GERALT: Kings only keep their promises when it suits them.ROCHE: We saw him together. You heard what he said.GERALT: You didn\\'t have Anaïs then. Now you do. Take a minute - consider your options.ROCHE: I\\'m a soldier, not a diplomat.GERALT: Well, you need to start thinking like a diplomat. You\\'re about to decide Temeria\\'s future. Do you trust Radovid? GERALT: Do you trust Radovid?ROCHE: I want to believe kings don\\'t generally spout nonsense.GERALT: Kings never say what they mean, only what they want you to hear.Stop and think - what else could you do? GERALT: What else could you do?ROCHE: Nothing. I either break my pledge to Radovid or honor it.GERALT: Suppose you break it?ROCHE: I\\'ll make another enemy.GERALT: Enemies are something you can handle - you said so yourself. The Temerian delegation is in Loc Muinne, maybe we should consider handing the child over to them.ROCHE: John Natalis... Good soldier, poor politician.GERALT: Natalis may not be the most polished diplomat, but both your grandmothers tilled the same soil, your grandfathers fought side by side.ROCHE: By taking the child to John Natalis, I\\'ll spark a civil war. The barons won\\'t acknowledge her right to the throne until they feel a boot on their neck.Freedom comes at a price. GERALT: I don\\'t claim giving her to the Temerians will solve all your problems. But freedom\\'s precious, Vernon - one of those things you don\\'t appreciate until it\\'s gone... Consider what they\\'ll say in Temeria when they hear Vernon Roche handed their crown princess to the head of a foreign state?ROCHE: If Radovid keeps to his word, they just might name a holiday after me.GERALT: Careful, Vernon. It\\'s a slippery slope. You could easily be branded a traitor, and brands are tough to scrub off.ROCHE: I guess you\\'re right. Dishonored I’ll be no one - not in Temeria, not anywhere else. Natalis it is.ROCHE: Come, child. I\\'ll take you to a safe place.Radovid has heavy boots. GERALT: I don\\'t doubt Radovid will bring the Temerian barons in line. Question is, will he stop there?ROCHE: It\\'s risky, I know. But when I\\'m to choose between civil war and an uncertain alliance with Redania, I choose the latter.Radovid is your best option. GERALT: A war where brother stands against brother is a curse.ROCHE: The child will go to Radovid.ROCHE: Come, Anaïs. I\\'ll take you to a safe place.You should give the child to the Temerians. GERALT: Temeria\\'s got a mess to clear, but in its own backyard. The neighbors needn\\'t help.ROCHE: You\\'ve convinced me. Radovid will have to consolidate his power without me.ROCHE: Come, child. I\\'ll take you to a safe place.What will Redania gain by preserving Temeria\\'s independence? GERALT: What would Radovid gain by allowing Temeria to remain independent?[If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Adda alive] ROCHE: Well, he married the eldest of Foltest\\'s daughters and will wait until she bears him a child... in which case he\\'ll marry Anaïs off to one of his barons. If Adda fails to produce an heir... he\\'ll rid himself of her.ROCHE: He\\'ll marry Anaïs and unite the two kingdoms.GERALT: Anaïs is not of age.ROCHE: But she will be! The kingdoms united could even resist Nilfgaard.A lot can happen before Anaïs reaches adulthood. GERALT: Anaïs won\\'t don the crown anytime soon. A lot could happen in the meantime, a lot could change.ROCHE: True enough, but you can\\'t predict everything.GERALT: Still, it might be worth trying.[Continues the same as \"Stop and think - what else can you do?\"]You\\'re right. GERALT: The armies of Redania and Temeria combined would indeed be a great force.ROCHE: And so it will be!To Radovid, then. GERALT: If you have no doubts, then...ROCHE: I see no one else who could ensure her safety in this chaos. I cannot put her on the Temerian throne myself.GERALT: Then go see Radovid.ROCHE: Come, Anaïs. I\\'ll take you to a safe place.Too great, perhaps? GERALT: Are you sure that force won\\'t turn against Temeria?ROCHE: Geralt, the choice is simple. I either give the child to Radovid or to the Temerian delegation. True, there\\'s always the risk that Radovid\\'s lying. There\\'s no guarantee he\\'ll keep to his word. But this is our chance to preserve Temeria\\'s independence.GERALT: It\\'ll become a Redanian protectorate.ROCHE: But in one piece. As a full member of the Council of Northern Realms. If I give Anaïs to the Temerians, at least as many will oppose her being crowned as will support it. She\\'s not of age and born out of wedlock - the debates will go on forever. This is more than mere politics, Geralt. Passions are at play and that could mean civil war.Radovid is your best option. GERALT: A war where brother stands against brother is a curse.ROCHE: The child will go to Radovid.ROCHE: Come, Anaïs. I\\'ll take you to a safe place.You should give the child to the Temerians. GERALT: Temeria\\'s got a mess to clear, but in its own backyard. The neighbors needn\\'t help.ROCHE: You\\'ve convinced me. Radovid will have to consolidate his power without me.ROCHE: Come, child. I\\'ll take you to a safe place.[As Geralt, Roche, and Anaïs exit the basement, knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose arrive.]GERALT: Hm, looks like someone\\'s provided an escort.[If they agreed to give Anaïs to Natalis] ROCHE: We need that like we need an axe in the head.[If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Siegfried alive] GERALT: It could be worse. Siegfried\\'s here.ORDER KNIGHT: In the name of King Radovid, we demand that you hand over the child of Louisa La Valette.[If they decided to give Anaïs to Natalis] [If Siegfried is present] SIEGFRIED: You got out of the Kaedweni camp intact - not an easy feat.GERALT: Practice makes perfect. It\\'s good to see you, Siegfried.SIEGFRIED: King Radovid is impatient to see Louisa La Valette\\'s child.ROCHE: You mean King Foltest\\'s daughter.ROCHE: He\\'ll have to wait a little longer...SIEGFRIED: What do you mean by that?GERALT: We\\'re taking the child to the Temerian camp. That\\'s where she belongs.SIEGFRIED: Radovid\\'s orders are clear...GERALT: What if I ask you to forget those orders, bearing in mind our... past?SIEGFRIED: I didn\\'t see you...GERALT: Because we were never here.ROCHE: Thank you, Grand Master.SIEGFRIED: Get to work, brethren! I want this battleground searched thoroughly.ORDER KNIGHT: Aye, sir!ROCHE: Time we were on our way.[If Siegfried is absent] GERALT: We\\'re headed elsewhere.ORDER KNIGHT: Not my concern. My orders are clear.ROCHE: We are not Radovid\\'s subjects. His orders don\\'t apply to us.ORDER KNIGHT: If you won\\'t come peacefully...ROCHE: Look around before you threaten us again, you fool.ROCHE: Anaïs, hide in the building![Geralt and Roche kill the knights of the Order.]GERALT: So, to the Temerian camp?ROCHE: We\\'ve lost a lot of time. The talks have probably begun.ROCHE: Come, child. [Geralt, Roche, and Anaïs make their way out of Dethmold\\'s camp.][If Henselt is dead] ROCHE: At least that scumbag is no longer among the living.GERALT: Only I know who killed Henselt. Dethmold\\'s different. Remember, he had many powerful friends.ROCHE: As head of the special forces, I\\'ve always had powerful foes. Somehow, I manage to deal with them.[If Henselt is alive] GERALT: Henselt will want to avenge his dead sorcerer.ROCHE: Henselt hates me anyway, for humiliating him when he was in my hands. I\\'m never short of enemies. I\\'ve learned to live with it.GERALT: You never know how the Temerians will receive Anaïs.ROCHE: She\\'s of royal blood... That should be enough.GERALT: Many in Temeria believe the bloodline ended with Foltest.ROCHE: What are you trying to tell me?GERALT: That some of your countrymen may already see themselves as the founders of a new dynasty.ROCHE: If you want to find me, I\\'ll be at the talks.GERALT: See you, Vernon.[If they decided to give Anaïs to Radovid] [If Siegfried is present] SIEGFRIED: You got out of the Kaedweni camp intact - not an easy feat.GERALT: Practice makes perfect. It\\'s good to see you, Siegfried.SIEGFRIED: King Radovid is impatient to see Louisa La Valette\\'s child.ROCHE: You mean King Foltest\\'s daughter.ROCHE: Pity he didn\\'t help us rescue her from Dethmold\\'s grasp.SIEGFRIED: The King of Redania could hardly be accused of breaking a covenant during a peace summit. Besides, we had a problem with the gate.ROCHE: In that case you were helpful after all. I lost the key.[If Siegfried is absent] GERALT: Shame you didn\\'t show up earlier.ORDER KNIGHT: Pay heed to whom you\\'re talking.ROCHE: Pay heed to the corpses of those who were impolite to us.ORDER KNIGHT: You\\'re lucky Radovid told us to stay calm.ROCHE: I\\'ll be sure to thank him personally for that.[Geralt and Roche go with the Knights of the Order.]GERALT: Beware of Radovid, Vernon.ROCHE: Rest assured, I\\'d never forgive myself if the heiress to Foltest\\'s throne came to any harm.GERALT: Don\\'t ever take your eyes off her. I wouldn\\'t be surprised to learn Radovid had a hand in Boussy\\'s death.ROCHE: Anything\\'s possible. Anaïs is Temeria\\'s last chance for ultimate independence. Freedom will come, sooner or later.[If Siegfried is present] SIEGFRIED: What are you plotting?ROCHE: We\\'re exchanging fencing tips.SIEGFRIED: Ah. Speaking of which, how was your meeting with Dethmold?ROCHE: Profitable for me, though he lost his family jewels.[If Henselt is dead] GERALT: Suppose Radovid asks you to serve the Redanian crown?ROCHE: Not impossible. What would you suggest?GERALT: I always advise caution when dealing with kings.ROCHE: Funny, I\\'ve always had the upper hand when dealing with them.[If Siegfried is present] SIEGFRIED: The Redanian colors would suit you, Vernon.ROCHE: I\\'ll think about it.SIEGFRIED: What are your plans now, Geralt?GERALT: I have unfinished business.[If Henselt is alive] GERALT: Plan to serve Radovid now?ROCHE: Ha-ha. Henselt won\\'t have me. Temeria is all I care about. I\\'ll serve it best under Radovid.[The party reaches the exit of the sewers.][If Siegfried is present] ROCHE: I\\'m off to the talks. I\\'ll wait for you there.SIEGFRIED: So long, Geralt. I hope we\\'ll meet again soon.GERALT: I\\'ll try to make it.[If Siegfried is absent] ROCHE: I can breathe easier now that the scumbag is dead.GERALT: Revenge unburdens you of your past, but it also affects your future.[Continues in A Summit of Mages (Roche).]  7.8 - A SUMMIT OF MAGES (TRISS) < PREV CONTENTS NEXT >[Geralt meets Triss outside the amphitheatre.]TRISS: We are about to witness a great event.Give me a minute.

Let\\'s go inside.TRISS: It\\'s now or never...[Inside the amphitheatre, Natalis is speaking.]NATALIS: In recent weeks, we have deliberated extensively in Vizima on who is to succeed to the Temerian throne.NATALIS: Because the fate of Foltest\\'s last child remains unknown, we could not reach an agreement.NATALIS: Unable to reconcile the interests of the esteemed Temerian houses, we have no choice but to divide the country into provinces along the baronies\\' current borders.RADOVID: This cannot be, John Natalis. Temeria stands between Nilfgaard and the North. It must be a strong and united realm.NATALIS: I, too, would wish it so, Your Majesty, but when Foltest was cut down by an assassin, the country\\'s very heart burst.RADOVID: I have learned that Anaïs La Valette is currently in the hands of the sorcerer Dethmold.NATALIS: Clearly you have yet to learn of the slaughter that occurred today in the Kaedweni camp, King Radovid.RADOVID: Yet there is hope if the child lives.[If Radovid knows Roche killed Henselt] NATALIS: I shall do everything in my power to find her.NATALIS: Simultaneously, I wish to announce that the commander of the Temerian Special Forces, one Vernon Roche, is officially a wanted man. All privileges appertaining to him as an officer of the realm are hereby repealed.[If Radovid doesn\\'t know] RADOVID: I hasten to remind you that Vernon Roche, his capture, is also your responsibility.RADOVID: He is suspected of murdering King Henselt soon after the monarch\\'s triumph in Vergen. As a Temerian soldier, Roche remains under your jurisdiction, Natalis.NATALIS: Vernon Roche disappeared with his unit a few days after the successful siege of La Valette Castle. Should he reappear in Temeria, he shall be arrested and tried as the law prescribes.[Geralt and Triss arrive and descend into the amphitheatre. Carduin, a mage who was a Council member at Thanedd, is the main spokesperson for the potential new Conclave.]CARDUIN: To the matter at hand. The document describing the charter of the Council and the Conclave is, as previously ascertained, an exact copy of the charter found in the ruins on Thanedd island.CARDUIN: The more important question relates to the Conclave and its power to designate royal advisors. Today, randomly chosen mages and sorceresses reside at many courts. However, in the time of the previous Conclave, such persons were carefully chosen.RADOVID: Why shouldn\\'t we pick our own advisors?CARDUIN: These individuals bear great responsibility, Your Majesty. The Conclave needs to be certain they are competent.RADOVID: And that they will keep the Conclave\\'s interests in mind.CARDUIN: Obviously, Sire. The Conclave\\'s chief interest is the well-being and prosperity of the Northern Kingdoms. The document has been signed by every member of the Conclave we have proposed, as well as by all but one of the designated advisors. We await only Síle de Tansarville\\'s signature...RADOVID: Without our royal seals you shall be allowed to designate advisors to cowherds at most.CARDUIN: That is true, Your Majesty.[Triss confronts Carduin.]TRISS: Síle de Tansarville should never be allowed to sign this document.CARDUIN: Triss Merigold. You decided to join us after all...TRISS: De Tansarville has royal blood on her hands. She can\\'t sit on the Conclave.SÍLE: That is a lie!RADOVID: Have you anything to support these claims, Merigold?TRISS: There are witnesses who will confirm that Síle de Tansarville was behind the assassinations of Demavend and Foltest.RADOVID: Officials of the future Council and Conclave, Síle de Tansarville should be arrested and tried. If Triss Merigold speaks the truth, Lady de Tansarville will be condemned to death.[Knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose march down into the amphitheatre, menacing Síle with weapons.]CARDUIN: Síle de Tansarville. Until Triss Merigold\\'s charges are dismissed or refuted, you cannot sit on the Conclave.RADOVID: Arrest her.SÍLE: You don\\'t know the whole truth! Merigold doesn\\'t know what she\\'s talking about![Síle raises her hands. A growl sounds, and a dragon descends on the amphitheatre, flaming the knights.

Farewell.[A character animatic plays.\\xa0GERALT, NARRATING: Roche had murder in his eyes. He wanted blood and couldn\\'t care less that it was royal, that this was what Letho would have wanted. The death of a king is the triumph of chaos, civil war, famine, fear among common folk, a time of disdain. That is the only reason Henselt remains alive and Kaedwen grows stronger. Thousands of Kaedwenis live better lives because their ruler is an amoral, ruthless son of a bitch who stands above the law.][Geralt meets Roche at the entrance to the amphitheatre. Anaïs is with him, playing in the stones.]ROCHE: This will be a great moment. Ready?Mhm. GERALT: Let\\'s get this done.Give me a minute. GERALT: I\\'ll be back soon.ROCHE: Remember, Temeria\\'s fate hangs in the balance.[Inside the amphitheatre, Natalis is speaking.]NATALIS: Temeria is internally divided. As Constable of Temeria, I\\'m in no position to speak for the whole country regarding the Council and the Conclave.NATALIS: I am honored to speak on Temeria\\'s behalf before this esteemed body... But I\\'m only the Constable. I cannot be sure some baron won\\'t cancel my signature in a week.RADOVID: What\\'s your point, Constable?NATALIS: I lack my country\\'s support regarding the Council and the Conclave. Neither do I intend to seek the crown, for I\\'ve lesser blood in my veins... And, as a soldier, I know my place in the ranks.[If Henselt is dead] NATALIS: In recent weeks, we have deliberated extensively in Vizima on who is to succeed to the Temerian throne. Because the fate of Foltest\\'s last child remains unknown, we could not reach an agreement.NATALIS: Unable to reconcile the interests of the esteemed Temerian houses, we have no choice but to divide the country into provinces along the baronies\\' current borders.[If Henselt is alive] HENSELT: Well said, John Natalis! Temeria, the realm separating the North from Emhyr var Emreis, and most importantly from his armies, is divided. And weak. Yet this land deserves law and order, which cannot be provided by the quarrelling rabble spoilt by Foltest\\'s generosity!HENSELT: Incessant wars between Temerian princelings are not in Kaedwen\\'s interest. Too many important trade routes run through the land.RADOVID: Redania will also take no comfort from unrest in Temeria. Therefore we cannot leave the realm to its own devices.NATALIS: Temeria is an independent state, well able to resolve its own problems. You seek to tear Foltest\\'s legacy to pieces! Appropriate what was never meant to be yours!HENSELT: Calm down, John Natalis. We will speak of that in due course - once we know with whom. As you said yourself, you cannot speak for all of Temeria.[Here the paths split depending on who Roche and Geralt decided to give Anaïs to.][If they decided to give Anaïs to Radovid] [If Henselt is dead] RADOVID: The North cannot afford a divided Temeria. Everyone knows what that will lead to. In a few years, the barons will be at each others\\' throats. No. A united Temeria means control of the western Pontar. A divided Temeria is an open highway for Nilfgaardian troops. The choice is simple.NATALIS: Simple for you, perhaps, King, but to guard my henhouse, I prefer five lame Temerian mutts to one healthy, beautiful Redanian hound.RADOVID: I understand the drama your country now faces, John Natalis, but the solution you propose is unacceptable.[If Henselt is alive] RADOVID: Constable Natalis is right after all. Temeria must endure as a strong kingdom.NATALIS: That is not the kingdom I had in mind.RADOVID: Yet that is the kingdom that will be. Ruled over by myself... and a virgin of Foltest\\'s blood.HENSELT: You stole the child?!RADOVID: Little girls need to be looked after, King.HENSELT: Noble attendees, I need to stress that the King of Redania, present here... has ploughed me without tallow!HENSELT: I am checkmated, though I\\'ll be damned if this is the last time our pawns meet on the chessboard. Next time, I shall be much the wiser.RADOVID: These are hard times.

You will hail me, Radovid, as your king.NATALIS: Even if you guarantee the kingdom remains united and separate, the Temerian nobility will never acquiesce to any limitations on sovereignty...[If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Adda is dead] RADOVID: The nobles will change their minds when they learn who is to be my future bride.[Geralt and Roche bring Anaïs to Radovid.]RADOVID: Allow me to introduce her... the future Lady of Tretogor, the Queen of Redania - Anaïs.NATALIS: Anaïs La Valette! How...?RADOVID: She was rescued from the hands of the sorcerer Dethmold, whose business in Loc Muinne is shrouded in mystery.[If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Adda alive] RADOVID: Remember who sits at my side in Tretogor. Adda, Foltest\\'s daughter.NATALIS: All Temerians remember that, Your Majesty. They also know that Foltest\\'s other daughter is still alive.

How...?RADOVID: She was rescued from the hands of the sorcerer Dethmold, whose business in Loc Muinne is shrouded in mystery.RADOVID: She will remain under my protection until she comes of age. Then, should Temeria will it, you can have your queen. Until then, Anaïs will live in Tretogor.RADOVID: We will speak of this later, John Natalis. After all, we have not come here to crown children.GERALT: Do you think the child will ever sit on the Temerian throne?ROCHE: Everything is in Radovid\\'s hands.

I\\'ve been looking for him since Foltest\\'s assassination. Letho cheated all of us, we were deceived by his dull face and sluggish stare. Don\\'t you understand?! The Lodge sought a way to get rid of Demavend, that\\'s true. He was a weak, volatile king - Aedirn would eventually choke to death under his rule. We chose the lesser evil - he had to be eliminated, and Letho happened to be \"at hand.\"GERALT: Foltest? Henselt?SÍLE: We had nothing to do with that. After assassinating Demavend, Letho used our gold and magical support to find and meet Iorveth. The elf was to help him hide until the matter blew over. Or so I thought. The Lodge did not condemn Foltest to die.GERALT: Then who did?SÍLE: Nilfgaard. Letho is the king of liars and emperor of traitors! From the start he worked for the glory of the Great Sun and the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes. He lied to everyone. Me, Iorveth, your stupid little Triss... And you.GERALT: Got any evidence?SÍLE: A moment ago I received a message from the Lodge\\'s agent in Cintra. The Imperial army is on the move. They\\'re fording the Yaruga now. Do you think the North can defend itself in the current situation? Can you count on another miracle at Brenna?GERALT: I don\\'t know... But you made it all possible and you\\'ll answer for that. The stigma of treason is yours - for all time.SÍLE: We shall see, for no one will leave this city alive. No one will tell this story. Philippa controls the dragon. As soon as I disappear, it will turn the city into a flaming tomb.GERALT: The dragon attacked Foltest\\'s troops during the siege of La Valette Castle. That hardly supports your tale.SÍLE: We did not control it then. We may have lost a battle, but the war is just beginning. You, however, shall not take part in it. This is your end, witcher.SÍLE: Farewell![Síle activates her portal, but the light turns red instead of blue.]SÍLE: Something\\'s not right...SÍLE: The diamond! Someone replaced the diamond! This one\\'s flawed... I\\'ll be torn to bits... Geralt, remove it!!SÍLE: The diamond! Remove the diamond! I\\'ll give you anything you want![If Geralt does nothing, Síle will die in her portal malfunction. If he takes the diamond out of the megascope, she will live and give him some advice.]SÍLE: You waited long enough... Should you survive, go south, to Nilfgaard, where you\\'ll find Yennefer of Vengerberg. Farewell, witcher.[Síle teleports away successfully this time. The dragon breaks through the wall of the tower and attacks Geralt. He manages to make his way to the roof of the tower, and when she next comes in for a blow, leaps on her back and plunges his sword into the back of her neck. The two of them crash into the nearby forest, the dragon impaling itself on a tree.][Geralt may choose to kill the dragon or walk away; if he walks away, the dragon frees herself from the tree impaling her and then collapses. Back in Loc Muinne, the Order of the Flaming Rose are marching through the place, searching for sorceresses and executing people. Pyres of bodies litter the square. From the mountains, Radovid overlooks Loc Muinne in flames. A soldier approaches him.]SOLDIER: Your handiwork, sire.RADOVID: In the beginning, there was chaos.[Radovid and his entourage turn and leave.][Continued in the Epilogue.]Back to topDocument © Laurelnose.

He goes around and climbs the vines growing on the walls.] [Roche pulls Geralt up over the ledge and claps him on the back. If Anaïs was given to Radovid, Roche will be wearing red and a Redanian emblem.]ROCHE: How did it go with the dragon?GERALT: It had a hard landing... Impaled on a tree. [Dragon killed]GERALT: I had to kill it.ROCHE: The relentless march of time... Too bad, but there was really no choice. The sorceresses would\\'ve used it without hesitation.GERALT: Know the worst thing, Roche?GERALT: That was possibly the last dragon in this world. Gone... A beautiful, noble creature... The Lodge made it a simple tool. [Dragon spared]GERALT: But it\\'s still alive. I don\\'t kill dragons.ROCHE: The sorceresses could still use it.GERALT: Roche, it may be one of the last living dragons... I can\\'t simply slaughter it.ROCHE: All right, it\\'s simple, then. We need to get rid of Philippa.GERALT: I\\'ll leave you the honor.ROCHE: We\\'ll get them, witcher, the sorceresses have it coming. Radovid and the other kings already ordered firewood to be gathered for the pyres.GERALT: What about the Council and the Conclave?ROCHE: I\\'d sooner expect the proclamation of an inquisitorial synod.GERALT: Not all sorceresses deserve the stake.ROCHE: You can\\'t make an omelet...GERALT: ...Without breaking some eggs. I know. [If Anaïs was given to Radovid]GERALT: Doesn\\'t hurt to wear that Redanian eagle on your uniform?ROCHE: It\\'s just cloth. My true colors are on my skin, I\\'ll never change those.GERALT: You\\'re gonna serve Radovid?ROCHE: Mhm. Temeria needs a strong, independently-minded king and I\\'ve no better candidates. Besides, I have to protect Anaïs.GERALT: I see. [If Anaïs was given to Natalis]GERALT: How is the future queen of Temeria?ROCHE: She\\'s safe. She\\'s even started to speak. Old Natalis tried to give her a doll. Know what she said?GERALT: How would I?ROCHE: That she wants no more toys - she wants a sword and to learn how to fight. She wants to avenge her father\\'s death.GERALT: What did you do?ROCHE: Gave her my Special Forces dagger. I\\'ll teach her to defend herself, Natalis will teach her the art of war... She\\'ll be a good queen, I can feel it.GERALT: What about Letho? Did you capture him?ROCHE: Not entirely.GERALT: Meaning?ROCHE: Letho awaits you in the former Temerian camp. He sent a messenger.GERALT: Let\\'s go. Tell me what happened here on the way. [Inside Loc Muinne, blood is everywhere. Bodies fill the streets, impaled on stakes and thrown into piles.]ROCHE: Pillage, rape, murder... Not necessarily in that order.GERALT: Who on whom?ROCHE: The kings let their troops loose. They were supposed to deal with just the treacherous sorceresses, but they quickly decided every mage was a traitor.ROCHE: The soldiers vastly outnumbered the mages, who could do nothing with the magical blockades still in place throughout the city.ROCHE: When the rulers left the city surrounded by their armored cordons, soldiers in loose mobs went on a mage hunt. Most of the noted and powerful managed to flee, the others were hounded to death. [They come across a sorceress leaning over the body of another, cackling madly and crying.]GERALT: Calm down, I want to help.SORCERESS: Their eyes need to be opened! They must see!ROCHE: They\\'re dead.SORCERESS: I am too, but I opened my eyes and saw... Ha-ha...ROCHE: What did you see?SORCERESS: Peace summit! Peace summit! Peace summit!GERALT: The world\\'s gone mad.ROCHE: Let\\'s get out of here.GERALT: Stop, I heard something!ROCHE: More marauders. [If Anaïs was given to Radovid]TEMERIAN KNIGHT: He\\'s here! Kill the traitor! [If Anaïs was given to Natalis]ORDER KNIGHT: There he is! Radovid wants his head! [Geralt and Roche defeat the soldiers.]GERALT: What about the Nilfgaardians?ROCHE: They ran like hell. Rumor has it they\\'re behind it all.GERALT: That\\'s no rumor.ROCHE: How do you know?GERALT: From Síle. She was surprisingly knowledgeable.ROCHE: If it was the Nilfgaardians, then war\\'s inevitable. [Geralt and Roche enter the courtyard where the fountain is. It is filled with blood and bodies. Letho sits on the edge; Triss sits next to him, arms wrapped around her knees.]ROCHE: Letho.GERALT: Triss.ROCHE: All right, let\\'s end this.GERALT: No, Roche. I\\'m going alone.ROCHE: Why, Geralt?GERALT: Take care of Triss. Wait for me at the city gate. If I\\'m not back within the hour, leave without me.ROCHE: But...GERALT: Just do it, Roche. Please. I need to deal with this alone. [Triss comes up to the two of them.]GERALT: Are you all right?TRISS: Yes. He saved me from the Nilfgaardians... And defended me from the troops.GERALT: Time to end this. Roche is waiting... I\\'ll join you soon.TRISS: Geralt... He knows a lot.GERALT: I know, Triss. That\\'s why we need to talk.TRISS: Don\\'t get killed, witcher.GERALT: I won\\'t. [Geralt approaches Letho alone.] [Triss pulls Geralt up over the top of the ledge.]TRISS: Are you all right?GERALT: More or less.TRISS: And the dragon? [Dragon killed]GERALT: I had to kill it, unfortunately.TRISS: Unfortunately?GERALT: Philippa enslaved the dragon with her magic. If I\\'d let it live, we\\'d surely find it serving the Lodge of Sorceresses. Many more would\\'ve died. Before the sorceresses broke the creature\\'s will, it was noble and beautiful in its own way. But I\\'m dead tired of having to choose the lesser evil. [Dragon spared]GERALT: Let\\'s say it had a hard landing... Impaled itself on a tree.TRISS: Did you kill it?GERALT: It\\'s alive. You know I don\\'t kill dragons.TRISS: But Philippa\\'s...GERALT: In time, we\\'ll deal with her. You know that could be one of the last dragons alive. A noble and beautiful creature.TRISS: Let\\'s get out of here...GERALT: I guess Letho got away.TRISS: He\\'s... waiting for you.GERALT: Waiting?TRISS: Mhm. Where the Temerians made camp... Come on. Let\\'s go.GERALT: This should be interesting. What do you mean, waiting?GERALT: What do you mean, waiting? How do you know?TRISS: Utter chaos broke out after the dragon attacked. I tried to reach Philippa\\'s quarters... A terrified man approached me in one of the alleys, gave me a letter and begged me not to harm him. He said it was for you. The letter was short: \"I\\'m waiting in the Temerian camp - Letho.\" [Inside Loc Muinne, brambles block many of the paths and the city is more ruined than before.]GERALT: What happened here while I was gone?TRISS: All the kings had many more armed men than they should have had at a peace summit. During the evacuation, several skirmishes broke out. The Kaedwenis clashed with the Temerians, the Order\\'s knights raped two sorceresses and killed those who dared try to help them...GERALT: Do you think the Council and Conclave will survive?TRISS: They\\'re established, and that\\'s the only thing that prevented a wholesale massacre. Hard to say if they\\'ll survive, but for the time being, no one\\'s got any better ideas. Mages are a part of this world, whether people like it or not. They have to have their rights, their place... Otherwise, another Lodge will arise. [As they travel, they catch sight of Roche fending off attackers, protecting Anaïs.]KAEDWENI SOLDIER: Vernon Roche! Step away from the child!ROCHE: She\\'s of royal blood. Temerian! Too good for you whoresons!KAEDWENI: You\\'re an outlaw. Wanted in all the North. Hand over the child and perhaps the kings will show you mercy.ROCHE: I piss on Kaedweni mercy!TRISS: Roche!ROCHE: Triss! We can\\'t let them have her. This is Foltest\\'s daughter!KAEDWENI: I\\'ve heard enough! Grab them! [Geralt and Triss help Roche fight off the Kaedweni soldiers.]ROCHE: I failed. Dethmold got away. Thanks, Geralt!GERALT: Triss needed my help, you know that. The Nilfgaardians outwitted us all.ROCHE: What are you talking about?GERALT: They kidnapped Triss. The Emperor dispatched the kingslayers, using the Lodge as a decoy. All in order to breed chaos in the Northern Kingdoms. [Henselt dead]ROCHE: Temeria is lost! Radovid and Henselt will divide it between them. They\\'ve signed the relevant treaty. [Henselt alive]ROCHE: Temeria is lost. The barons will pick it apart into bits.TRISS: It\\'s not lost. Temeria will be reunited. Get the child out of here. Take her far away. Far from the kings, their courts and their wars. One day, she\\'ll reclaim her heritage.ROCHE: What about you, Geralt?GERALT: I\\'m going after the kingslayer.ROCHE: A man of his word.GERALT: It\\'s personal now.ROCHE: Farewell then, White Wolf. I trust we\\'ll meet again in better times.GERALT: Farewell, Roche. [Roche and Anaïs leave together.]GERALT: Where\\'s Iorveth? How\\'s Iorveth...?TRISS: Proud, I think. The reward on his head has never been greater... Those seeking him, the Scoia\\'tael hunters, will be reinforced. The special forces throughout the North will receive more resources. The Council and the Conclave are assigning several mages to the task. Iorveth is now public enemy number one. They won\\'t rest until they find him. [Geralt and Triss come across Carduin and a couple of mages casting spells to create more of the blockades.]CARDUIN: This is no place for witchers, though I know you, and you appear wherever something important happens.GERALT: True, though sometimes by accident.CARDUIN: And this time? Also a coincidence?GERALT: Let\\'s say I have something to take care of.CARDUIN: In that case, hurry. Once we\\'re done cleaning up this mess created by the royal soldiery, Loc Muinne will be magically sealed.GERALT: Getting out of here?CARDUIN: Temporarily. We shall return soon enough to rebuild the city. Loc Muinne will regain its former glory. Until that time, we need to keep the treasure hunters and troublemakers out.GERALT: So Radovid trusts you?CARDUIN: We shall win His Royal Majesty\\'s trust by delivering Síle de Tansarville and the other traitoresses from the Lodge. [If Síle lived]GERALT: That could take a while. Síle\\'s fled Loc Muinne - via megascope.CARDUIN: We have time. She cannot hide forever. Sooner or later she will be ours. [If Síle died]GERALT: De Tansarville will be a problem.CARDUIN: Admittedly, Síle can be slippery as an asp, but we\\'ll find her.GERALT: You don\\'t get it, Carduin. Síle de Tansarville\\'s dead. Killed by an unstable portal.CARDUIN: Shame... She was to be charged and tried... She would have been convicted of her crimes.GERALT: Why does it sound like she was convicted before standing trial?CARDUIN: It would have been a formality, true. And at once a warning to other sorceresses.GERALT: Seems to me she led you down the garden path.CARDUIN: Forgive me, I must attend to some matters. And don\\'t dawdle - the city will be sealed in one hour. [Geralt and Triss enter the courtyard where the fountain is. Letho is sitting on the edge of the fountain, tossing a diamond up and down.]TRISS: There he is.GERALT: Wait for me.TRISS: Geralt... This is witchers\\' business.GERALT: This is between me and him.TRISS: You don\\'t have to...GERALT: I do. He knows how I lost my memory. I fear for you.GERALT: I don\\'t want you to get hurt.TRISS: I can take care of myself.GERALT: Not this time. I need to talk to him alone.GERALT: Wait for me at the city gate. If I\\'m not there within the hour, leave without me. [Geralt approaches Letho alone.] [Geralt approaches the fountain where Letho waits.]LETHO: Took you a while...GERALT: Is that bauble from Síle\\'s megascope?LETHO: Mhm. My final prank... I switched the diamonds. The one in the megascope has a flaw - minute, but just large enough to warp the teleport. The Emperor\\'s magic theorists assured me the effect would be spectacular. [If Síle lived]GERALT: I let her escape.LETHO: You\\'re heartless. You\\'ve no idea what the royal witch-hunters have in store for her. A lot of pain for a long time...GERALT: I don\\'t doubt it. So, ready to lay your cards out on the table? [If Síle died]GERALT: Oh, it was.LETHO: Good. Had she lived, she would\\'ve suffered more intensely and much longer. She helped me quite a bit, through naiveté and pride. I would not have gotten far without her.GERALT: Hm. So, ready to lay your cards out on the table?LETHO: No matter the game, there comes a point when all the players need to show their cards. I love that moment. But first...LETHO: Vodka? Not me.GERALT: I only drink with friends.LETHO: What about old acquaintances? Heh... Let me have it.GERALT: I suppose my throat\\'s a little dry.LETHO: In that case, let\\'s drink to old friendships.LETHO: Recovered your memory yet?GERALT: Not entirely.LETHO: Remember how we first met?GERALT: Yeah. I saved your life. Couldn\\'t think of a nicer way to pay me back?LETHO: Frankly, I couldn\\'t. I mean, taking care of another man\\'s woman... Yennefer. I can\\'t fathom what you saw in her, but I suppose there\\'s no accounting for taste... [Geralt experiences a flashback. NARRATOR: The winter solstice, 1270. Midinvaerne – the night of magic.\\xa0Letho wasn\\'t lying - the Hunt had stopped. At the Hanged Man’s Tree, the spectral riders selected from among those they had taken. Yennefer was among them...\\xa0A wraith cannot be killed, only driven away. Every witcher knows that. Yet the riders fell beneath the blows of our witchers’ blades, crimson blood flowed from under their dead men’s armor. We could not kill them all - they were simply too many. A stalemate.\\xa0He was different from all other elves. There was no shame in his gaze. He had never suffered persecution, he had endured no massacres, humans had not taken his land. This elf was not of this world. He was an invader.\\xa0We struck a deal. My soul for that of Yennefer. He agreed without hesitation.]LETHO: Back with me, friend? Got the feeling you left for a minute...GERALT: Memories... I remember the Hanged Man\\'s Tree and the Wild Hunt. I remember the exchange - me for Yennefer.LETHO: So, cards out on the table. Unless you chased me all that way just to kill me... I chased you for many reasons.GERALT: I chased you for lots of reasons. You owe me - some explanations, to start with.LETHO: Let\\'s say I do. Why did you wait for me?GERALT: Why are you still here? Why did you wait for me this time?LETHO: I knew you wouldn\\'t give up, I knew you\\'d pursue me. And I don\\'t aim to hide anymore. Fact is, only you know the truth about me - well, and a couple of folks whose word isn\\'t worth spit anymore.LETHO: I never saw you as a foe. I want to go my way, but if I have to fight you first, so be it. This story ends here and now. Yennefer - tell me what happened to her.GERALT: Tell me about Yennefer. What happened after I... departed?LETHO: She was feverish for several days, delirious, in agony. We thought that was it - she was on her way out. Somehow she recovered, but even then she was disoriented. Amnesia, like you.GERALT: What then?LETHO: Well, the woman turned out to be quite a character. Throwing temper tantrums, trying to seduce Auckes, trying to drive a wedge between us. After you so nobly sacrificed yourself, we thought it\\'d be dumb just to leave her somewhere. She wouldn\\'t\\'ve survived more than a month. The whims and vigor of a duchess, but she was just a sorceress with no memory...LETHO: We were in the heart of the Empire, and as I\\'m sure you know, Geralt, in Nilfgaard mages who behave like that either drop their bad habits quickly or are drawn and quartered by horses in the middle of Victory Square.GERALT: So I heard.LETHO: So we set out, wandered through the provinces. Everywhere we went, she got in trouble and we pulled her out. And then one day they captured us - the Imperial secret police. Me, Auckes, Serrit and Yennefer.GERALT: Imperial secret police?LETHO: Mhm. We were separated, and they questioned us. Long and thoroughly, but it was uneventful, no violence.LETHO: That\\'s how I met Vattier de Ridaux, and a couple of weeks later, the Emperor himself. Me - a simple witcher.GERALT: What happened to Yennefer?LETHO: I dunno. Never saw her again. The Emperor offered me a mission in the Northern Kingdoms. As for Yennefer, I had the feeling she was somehow important to Emhyr. As I see it, they learned of the Lodge from her. Those Imperial spooks have their ways. All I heard is that Vattier had his men watch Yennefer closely throughout the time she was at the palace. Then we went off to slay the kings of the North, and that\\'s where my knowledge ends.GERALT: So she\\'s in the Empire.LETHO: She was when I left. Why did you become an imperial spy?GERALT: How did a witcher agree to kill humans at another human\\'s bidding?LETHO: At the Emperor\\'s bidding, Geralt. And he\\'s no ordinary human. The rulers of the North come up to about where his poleyns end.GERALT: Why?LETHO: Simple - he promised to rebuild the School of the Viper, the witchers\\' order where I came to be. Witchers\\' schools in the south fell into ruin long ago, and witchers themselves became internal exiles, banned from entering most cities.LETHO: Besides Serrit and Auckes, I know of two other witchers of the School of the Viper who should be alive and on the Path. I don\\'t know where they are, haven\\'t seen them for years. Now, they can come out of hiding, they can come home. What was it all about? What was the aim?GERALT: Care to tell me what it was all about?LETHO: Hm. Kill as many rulers as we could. Lay the blame on the sorceresses. Breed chaos. Prepare the North, soften it before the invasion.LETHO: And you know what\\'s incredible? We could not have imagined more fertile soil. No matter what the war\\'s outcome, the Northern monarchs\\'ll accuse one another, pursue their god-given rights, seek vengeance and be at each others\\' throats for years to come.LETHO: The North resembles a whorehouse on fire, as your friend Dandelion would say. How\\'d you learn about the Lodge?GERALT: Where\\'d you get your information about the Lodge?LETHO: From the Emperor and Vattier de Ridaux, the emperor\\'s chief spy. And I believe they got it out of Yennefer.GERALT: She recovered her memory?LETHO: Nah, I\\'d never claim she informed on her friends consciously. I expect they found a way to tap into her memory in spite of her amnesia and without her knowing it. There was a sorcerer present when I was questioned. A young, proud intelligence officer.LETHO: Whatever the case, they gave me a list of the sorceresses in the Lodge. Only Emhyr, Vattier and I were present. Only we knew of the mission. How did you find Síle?GERALT: How did you manage to contact Síle?LETHO: It wasn\\'t a problem once I learned of the Lodge\\'s existence. Initially, she watched my every move. But sooner or later, everyone starts treating me like a big oaf. I mean, I can\\'t change how I look.LETHO: I stayed close to Síle, killed a few beasts for her, and whined about how unhappy I was, how unfair the world was - so much, in fact, that I actually got her gander up a few times.LETHO: I made sure a few potentially trustworthy witnesses saw us together, could link us... Security, in case I was captured. I also prepared to assassinate the king of Kovir. Esterad Thyssen was to be the first victim of the mysterious assassins.LETHO: But before I could do the dirty deed, Síle asked me to slay Demavend. The gods had smiled upon me. I couldn\\'t believe my luck. Here I\\'d been trying to figure out how to frame Síle, and now all I needed was to carry out her orders and follow through. How did you kill Demavend?GERALT: How\\'d you manage to slay Demavend?LETHO: Síle\\'s magic. I mean she could give us the king\\'s every move, his habits, the positions of the palace guards, anything. All we had to do was navigate the labyrinth and land the final blow. Besides, she had plenty of gold for the preparations, greased palms abundantly. It had all the makings of a cakewalk, but it\\'s never that easy.LETHO: We barely avoided our pursuers. And we wouldn\\'t have if not for Iorveth\\'s Scoia\\'tael - another of Síle\\'s ideas. With Iorveth\\'s elves, not only did we cut down Demavend, but traveling with them put us out of the Lodge\\'s reach. We could calmly plan Foltest\\'s and Henselt\\'s assassinations. How did you know Foltest would get to the solar?GERALT: How did you know Foltest would come to the monastery\\'s solar?LETHO: Iorveth and I planned Foltest\\'s murder. The King of Temeria would have to deal with the La Valettes sooner or later, and he made no secret of it. I was sure he\\'d want to recover his bastard children in the process. And where do they take the children when a castle\\'s under siege?LETHO: I had to become a monk. But I couldn\\'t just arrive at the monastery and claim I\\'d seen the light. Not very believable...LETHO: So, one of Aryan\\'s patrols, out in the forests, happened on a Scoia\\'tael unit torturing a helpless monk. Aryan\\'s brave men drove off the elves, and I found shelter in the monastery.GERALT: No one noticed you had no wounds?LETHO: I paid the monk who treated me a lot of orens to stay silent. Actually, it was only a loan, \\'cause I killed him later. Only the dead can keep a secret.LETHO: Then all I had to do was wait for the situation to develop. When I saw you enter the chamber with Foltest, I thought I might fail... Luckily, you failed - to recognize an old friend... You failed to slay Henselt... [If Geralt sided with Iorveth]GERALT: You screwed up with Henselt.LETHO: Sabrina\\'s curse tore that down. First off, we got holed up in that hideout in the ravines. Then Síle showed up and started watching Henselt like he was her own ass.LETHO: By that time, his death was no longer necessary. Fate had smiled upon us again. I learned of the summit and the efforts to reconstitute the Council and Conclave. The ideal setting for the mission\\'s grand finale. [If Geralt sided with Roche]GERALT: Shame you didn\\'t take a shot at Henselt yourself. History might\\'ve taken a different turn.LETHO: Maybe I would\\'ve killed him. Maybe you would\\'ve killed me. Who knows. But Henselt\\'s death, although desirable, wasn\\'t necessary anymore. The plan could go forward without it. [If Henselt died]LETHO: Besides, somebody else got him.GERALT: You know who?LETHO: Come on. We both know. [If Henselt lived]LETHO: You killed Serrit and Auckes. Damn shame, as I see it. Two good witchers.GERALT: They were murderers, Letho. Just like you. Don\\'t change the subject.LETHO: Right. I was on my way to Loc Muinne by that time. I had to prepare, inform that prune Shilard of the plan. Everything had to play out perfectly. There was no room for error. Síle came to Flotsam looking for you.GERALT: So Síle was looking for you when she came to Flotsam.LETHO: Mhm. She thought she was still in control and wanted to get rid of me. I\\'d bet my eyes that she thought I\\'d lost my mind, or that Iorveth was manipulating me.GERALT: And the North descended deeper into chaos.LETHO: Exactly. There was just one problem - you. I could\\'ve killed you in the elven ruins. Thing is, you weren\\'t really my enemy...You wanted to take over Iorveth\\'s unit - what was the idea? GERALT: When did you decide to get rid of Iorveth?LETHO: As soon as I realized I couldn\\'t manipulate him. A true fox, that one. He was so observant, so dangerous. I got the sense he might see through me at any moment.GERALT: You made a mistake. You were untouchable as long as the Scoia\\'tael were protecting you.LETHO: Maybe, but with Iorveth, my hands were tied. If I\\'d finished off Ciaran...GERALT: But you didn\\'t, and that allowed me to drive a wedge between you and Iorveth. I forced you to flee.LETHO: And I let you live. You know I could\\'ve killed you. You\\'re forgetting...GERALT: No, I remember. The riders of the Hunt - you know who they are?GERALT: How did you know where we\\'d find the Wild Hunt?LETHO: Every witcher who wears the viper around his neck knows the place. We had so many books and scrolls about the Hunt that I used to think our school was founded for the very purpose of solving the riddle of the spectral riders.GERALT: Know who they are? You know the true identities of the riders?LETHO: From what I understand, they\\'re some damn elven race. But they turned out to be a big ruse. The legendary omen of war proved to be a fairground attraction...GERALT: No market square mage could possibly conjure up a cavalcade of wraiths speeding across the sky. Then there\\'s the amnesia. No, they\\'re something more, I assure you.LETHO: Go ahead, enlighten me. I can tell you want to.GERALT: There are a lot of legends and myths about it, but the Wild Hunt is a fact. I\\'ve fought and killed many of its wraiths. They were spectral emanations, the avatars of real riders... The riders we ran into by the Hanged Man\\'s Tree.LETHO: Are you telling me you were carried off by elves? Real, material sons of bitches, like the ordinary kind we deal with in this world?GERALT: They may be ordinary in their world, but they\\'re strangers in ours. The Conjunction of Spheres - know the theory? Do you know how monsters appeared in our world?LETHO: There\\'s not a witcher who doesn\\'t know that.GERALT: So you know there are other Spheres. The most powerful of our mages can open passages between these worlds, and they usually do that to summon the monsters we then have to hunt.GERALT: The elves we saw come from another world. And they weren\\'t summoned, they found the way on their own. It\\'s not exactly easy, so they usually send their spectral emanations. They come in person on special missions.LETHO: As they did for you and Yennefer.GERALT: Mhm.LETHO: So, elves from another world and their trained wraiths... What did they want from you?GERALT: I\\'ve got an idea, but that\\'s not your concern. Let\\'s finish this.GERALT: I\\'m done talking. Let\\'s finish this...LETHO: Want to fight?GERALT: Any vodka left in that bottle?LETHO: A swig apiece. Here.[Geralt and Letho each take a swig.]LETHO: The imperial army is probably crossing the Yaruga as we speak. Pure pandemonium will ensue. The North\\'s finished. Time to go south, where the good life awaits.GERALT: You\\'re a fool, Letho. Both you and your emperor are forgetting one thing... Misfortune brings people together. Very shortly, the North could be united like never before. Thanks to you... But that\\'s just not my concern anymore...LETHO: I\\'m not your foe, I never was. Let me walk away and I will - you\\'ll never see me again. Force me to fight, and this time I\\'ll kill you. Go. Somewhere far away.GERALT: I\\'ve learned all I wanted to know. I can feel the memories coming back. Your death won\\'t change a thing. Go where you will.LETHO: Just like that? No threats? No words of wisdom?GERALT: You going or not?LETHO: Huh. Farewell, Geralt.[Letho leaves.] Give it your best shot.GERALT: Time to fight. Ready?LETHO: As I\\'ll ever be.[Geralt and Letho clash.]LETHO: The wolf has teeth.GERALT: And they\\'re sharp.LETHO: I\\'m better - I can tell already.GERALT: Of course you can.LETHO: You tire quickly.GERALT: I\\'m tired of your talking.LETHO: You fear death?GERALT: Stop whining and fight.LETHO: What does it feel like to be almost dead?GERALT: I said, fight.LETHO: I don\\'t want to kill you.GERALT: And I\\'ll kill you gladly.LETHO: You\\'re nowhere near my level.GERALT: Course not. I\\'m no kingslayer. [Geralt defeats Letho, and walks away.][WIP][Geralt leaves Loc Muinne together with either Triss or Triss and Roche.] [DANDELION, NARRATING: The witcher had traveled far and wide in search of the kingslayers. In Flotsam, he slew Bernard Loredo, but few mourned for the commandant. Flotsam remained Temerian, while command of the garrison and town went to a Viziman noble - a sworn enemy of Kaedwen and an avid angler. To this day folk gather round bonfires in Lobinden to hear of the witcher\\'s deeds.\\xa0The witcher witnessed a great Kaedweni victory in Aedirn. At Vergen, Henselt\\'s army crushed Saskia the Dragonslayer\\'s motley force, ending the springtime of races. Soldiers of the Unicorn swarmed over the Pontar Valley. As it had before, powerful Kaedwen swallowed Upper Aedirn whole. Yet subsequent events would render Henselt\\'s triumph short-lived.\\xa0[If Geralt rescued Triss] After Foltest\\'s death, Temeria\\'s neighbors began to vie for the glittering prize that was the realm\\'s throne. Yet the murders of first Demavend, then Henselt, forced them to look to their own problems. Temeria fell prey to its power-hungry barons. But Vernon Roche held a light of hope for the dying realm and he tucked it away in a place safe and still to await better times.\\xa0[If Geralt rescued Anaïs and sent her to Radovid] When King Foltest fell at the hands of an assassin, chaos engulfed his realm. Where others saw spoils, Roche saw his motherland bleeding. Vernon made a difficult choice, surrendering Foltest\\'s daughter to Radovid. The Redanian ruler, trump card in hand, turned Temeria into his protectorate and began restoring peace. The kingdom\\'s inhabitants soon learned why Radovid was called \"The Stern.\"\\xa0[If Geralt rescued Anaïs and sent her to Natalis] With Foltest slain, Temeria\\'s barons began to vie for the throne. Many dreamt of donning the crown, yet none could assemble the allies required to snatch it. The kingdom\\'s last hope, as it teetered on the edge of civil war, lay in little Anaïs. Natalis was named regent and ruled the land, yet the girl was the living symbol of the realm\\'s salvaged unity.\\xa0[If Triss intervened at the Summit] Years before, Geralt of Rivia had witnessed the fall of the Council and Conclave of mages. The summit in Loc Muinne re-established both bodies... their founders sacrificing Síle de Tansarville and her accomplices. Yet Radovid also required humility and loyalty from the proud mages. But this did not sit well with all of them.\\xa0[If Triss was not at the Summit] A tempest descended upon the North - at least partly the work of manipulative mages. It seemed the turmoil in Temeria, Aedirn, and Kaedwen would benefit them most. Common folk turned against sorceresses and all \"magic freaks,\" witchers included. Castles that had hitherto welcomed mavens of the magical arts now shut their gates to any who sought shelter there. A witch hunt ensued.\\xa0It was a time of great uncertainty, of rape accomplished by royal decree. Yet as troubled as the days seemed, we who had in some way shaped the world\\'s fate finally received some respite. Zoltan resumed the quest for his beloved\\'s hand, and I laid my head in the laps of the muses. Who could have known this tempest which had ravaged the North was but a harbinger of darker days? And the preamble to an entirely new tale of Geralt of Rivia.] [After the credits, a villager can be seen hunting rabbits in a forest. He returns with his catch to a bridge, only to stop as a line of Nilfgaardian horsemen appear. They gallop past him, running him over and knocking him unconscious. When he awakens, he stumbles back to his village to find it in flames and filled with Nilfgaardian soldiers. The scene zooms out to the map to show a black line engulfing the North from the south.] [Title text: The world as we know it nears its end, yet the past remains the key to the future...]')]"
